### Title: **West Lothian Affordable Housing Programme: Q2 2024/25 Update**

### Key Information:

1. **Programme Overview**:
   - The report provides an update on the progress of the Affordable Housing Programme to 2027/28, aligning with West Lothian’s Local Housing Strategy (LHS) 2023-2028.
   - The target is to deliver a minimum of 1,621 affordable homes over five years, including 383 new council homes and 1,238 homes from Registered Social Landlords (RSLs).

2. **Progress to Date**:
   - Since the beginning of the 2022/23 financial year, 1,127 affordable homes have been completed, reaching 69.5% of the overall target.
   - As of the end of Q2 2024/25, 507 homes are under construction or committed for future completion.
   - Current projects are on track to deliver 1,634 homes, slightly above the initial target but reduced by 114 units compared to earlier projections due to funding challenges.

3. **Housing Completions (Q2 2024/25)**:

6. **Funding and Financial Adjustments**:
   - **Resource Planning Assumptions (RPA)**: The RPA for 2024/25 was reduced from £15.43 million to £11.674 million, but an uplift of £2.002 million brought the total to £13.676 million (a net 11% reduction).
   - **Impact**: Reduction in grant funding may delay or reduce the scope of planned developments. The council prioritizes new build projects to maintain progress despite funding uncertainties.

7. **Risks and Challenges**:
   - The significant reduction in funding from the Affordable Housing Supply Programme affects future approvals, potentially slowing the pace of affordable housing projects.
   - Uncertainty around future funding remains a key risk as many projects span multiple years, necessitating consistent funding assurance.

8. **Future Outlook**:
   - The council continues to explore options to maximize resources, including additional open market acquisitions and leveraging partnerships with RSLs.
   - Continued collaboration with the Scottish Government aims to secure further funding to support ongoing and future projects.
   - If additional funds become available, it may mitigate the risks of reduced housing approvals and facilitate the continuation of strategic projects across West Lothian.

### Conclusion:
The Affordable Housing Programme for West Lothian is progressing well, with 1,127 homes completed and a target of 1,634 homes in total. Despite funding cuts, the council remains committed to delivering affordable housing through strategic planning, prioritizing high-demand areas, and continued engagement with RSL partners. However, funding reductions pose a risk to the long-term sustainability and expansion of the programme, highlighting the need for ongoing efforts to secure financial support.
