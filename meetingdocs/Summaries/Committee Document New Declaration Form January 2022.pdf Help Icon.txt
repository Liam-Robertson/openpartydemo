### Title: **Code of Conduct and Declarations of Interest Form - January 2022**

### Key Information:

1. **Purpose**:
   - This form serves as a guide for council members to understand and comply with the Code of Conduct regarding declarations of interest during meetings. It aims to ensure transparency and accountability in decision-making.

2. **Declaring Interests**:
   - **Objective Test**: Members must apply the "objective test" to determine if a connection to an agenda item constitutes an interest. This involves considering whether a well-informed member of the public would view the connection as significant enough to influence decision-making.
   - If a connection is considered an interest, members are required to:
     - Declare the interest clearly, providing enough detail for public understanding.
     - Leave the meeting room (physically or online) when the item is discussed.
     - Avoid contacting colleagues participating in the discussion of the item.

3. **Identifying Connections**:
   - A connection exists if there is a link between the agenda item and:
     - The council member themselves.
     - Individuals associated with the member (e.g., family, business partners, employers).
     - Organizations associated with the member (e.g., community groups, charities).
   - Common scenarios considered connections include employment, personal relationships, or membership in relevant organizations.

4. **Exceptions**:
   - Certain connections do not need to be declared as interests, such as:
     - Being a taxpayer, ratepayer, or council tenant.
     - Discussions on public services, councillorsâ€™ remuneration, expenses, or pensions.
     - Participation in outside bodies appointed by the council unless regulatory decisions or personal conflicts are involved.

5. **Voluntary Declarations**:
   - Even if a connection does not amount to an interest, members may choose to make a statement about it for transparency.

6. **Guidance and Support**:
   - For clarification or support, members are encouraged to contact designated officers:
     - James Millar (Interim Monitoring Officer and Governance Manager)
     - Carol Johnston (Chief Solicitor and Depute Monitoring Officer)
     - Committee Services Team

7. **Supporting Documents**:
   - References are made to relevant guidelines including:
     - The Councillors' Code of Conduct.
     - Standards Commission Guidance on declarations of interest.
     - An advice note on how to declare interests.

### Conclusion:
The document emphasizes the importance of clarity, transparency, and ethical behavior in council meetings. It provides a clear process for identifying and declaring interests, alongside exceptions and voluntary declaration options to ensure members adhere to the highest standards of public service integrity.
