### Title: **Proposed Amendments to Affordable Housing Supplementary Guidance (AHSG) - October 2024**

### Key Information:

1. **Purpose of the Amendments**:
   - The West Lothian Council is revising its Affordable Housing Supplementary Guidance (AHSG) to address a housing emergency, changing economic conditions, and reduced funding.
   - The updates aim to ensure that the guidance remains effective in supporting the West Lothian Local Development Plan (LDP) and addresses current challenges in the housing sector.

2. **Background**:
   - The AHSG was last adopted in 2019. Since then, economic pressures, including increased construction costs and reduced government funding, have necessitated a review.
   - The Council declared a housing emergency on 28 May 2024, driven by rising demand, funding cuts, and issues such as increased construction material costs due to global factors (e.g., the war in Ukraine and Brexit).
   - Current housing targets are at risk, with over 1,600 units identified in the Strategic Housing Investment Plan (SHIP) that may not receive funding.

3. **Key Proposed Changes**:
   - **Commuted Sums**:
     - Amendments aim to recalibrate how commuted sums (financial contributions from developers instead of on-site affordable housing) are calculated, as current methods can lead to undervalued sums.
     - The revised policy would ensure more equitable sums, reflective of market values and developer benefits when land is not allocated for affordable housing.
   - **Retention of Affordable Housing Land**:
     - Proposed changes include provisions to retain any land designated for affordable housing in perpetuity, supporting long-term development.
   - **Calculation Adjustments**:
     - Removal of outdated wording in the guidance and introduction of clearer valuation methods, which will be independently reviewed to ensure fairness.

4. **Policy Context**:
   - The changes align with national frameworks like the National Planning Framework 4 (NPF4) and recent legislative provisions, allowing the Council to continue using supplementary guidance until March 2025.
   - The amendments aim to strengthen negotiating power and ensure a consistent approach in the absence of on-site affordable housing provisions, particularly important given reduced funding.

5. **Challenges and Economic Factors**:
   - The economic landscape has significantly changed, with rising construction costs and reduced subsidies affecting the feasibility of affordable housing projects.
   - Funding cuts announced for the Affordable Housing Supply Programme (AHSP) have reduced budgets to £13.676 million for 2024/25, with further declines projected for future years.

6. **Next Steps**:
   - The proposed amendments will undergo an eight-week consultation period starting November 2024, engaging stakeholders, including developers, housing associations, and professionals in planning and surveying.
   - The final updated guidance will be presented to the Council Executive in January 2025 for approval before being submitted to Scottish Ministers. The aim is for adoption by 31 March 2025.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The revised AHSG is intended to address the immediate housing emergency, adapt to economic challenges, and ensure affordable housing projects continue in West Lothian.
   - The Council seeks to implement these changes proactively, before the adoption of the Local Development Plan 2 (LDP2), ensuring that affordable housing provision remains a priority.

### Summary:
The proposed amendments to the Affordable Housing Supplementary Guidance reflect West Lothian Council’s efforts to adapt to a housing emergency and economic challenges. Key changes include adjustments to how commuted sums are calculated, provisions for the long-term retention of affordable housing land, and alignment with national policies. The Council’s approach emphasizes collaboration, strategic planning, and adaptability to maintain progress in affordable housing development amid reduced funding.
