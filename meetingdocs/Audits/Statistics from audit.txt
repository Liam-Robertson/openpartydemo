#### Summary:
Page 46 starts with the **Notes to the Annual Accounts** section, beginning with **Note 1 - Accounting Policies**. This page outlines the primary accounting principles and policies followed by the council in preparing the financial statements. It explains how financial transactions are recognized and measured, including accruals, asset valuations, income recognition, and more.

#### Detailed Statistics:

- **De minimis level**: Assets with a cost of below **£10,000** are not treated as long-term assets but charged to the revenue account. For 2022/23, this limit was **£6,000**.
- **Valuation basis for council houses**: Council houses were valued using the **Beacon Principle** for social housing. This valuation is in line with guidance from the **Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS)**.
  
- **Council House Revaluation**: The council houses were last revalued by the **Valuation Office Agency (DVS Property Specialists)** during 2020/21.

- The **Capital Fund balance as of 31 March 2024** was **£28.3 million**. This fund was established to ensure borrowing decisions and capital programs are aligned with Best Value considerations.

### Page 47

#### Summary:
Page 47 continues **Note 1 - Accounting Policies** and covers various financial reporting policies, including lease accounting, employee benefits, reserves, and public-private partnership (PPP) arrangements. The focus is on the council's policies for recognizing income, debt management, and capital funding.

#### Detailed Statistics:

- **Employee Benefits**: A charge is made against services in the Surplus or Deficit on the Provision of Services for the cost of holiday entitlements earned by employees but not taken before year-end. This is reversed out of the General Fund Balance by a credit to the **Employee Statutory Adjustment Account** in the Movement in Reserves Statement.

- **Finance Leases**: Assets acquired under finance leases are capitalized with a liability to pay outstanding rentals. The payments are apportioned between the finance charge and reducing the outstanding obligation. The finance charge is allocated to revenue over the lease's term.

- **Public Private Partnership (PPP) Arrangements**: The note discusses PPP service concessions. Flexibility was applied to service concession contracts before 1 April 2022 under Scottish Government Finance Circular 10/2022. In 2023/24, an adjustment of **£3.277 million** was made under these provisions, following a **£27.603 million** adjustment in 2022/23. This impacts the council’s capital financing requirement but remains within the council’s financial plans.

### Page 48

#### Summary:
Page 48 continues **Note 1 - Accounting Policies**, focusing on property, plant, and equipment as well as income recognition from grants. It elaborates on how asset impairments are handled and how grant income is accounted for based on whether the council acts as a principal or an agent.

#### Detailed Statistics:

- **Impairment of assets**: Assets subject to revaluation that experience a reduction in value are impaired. Impairment losses are accounted for as follows:
  - If there is a balance in the **Revaluation Reserve**, the carrying amount of the asset is written down against that balance (up to the accumulated gains).
  - If there is **no balance** in the Revaluation Reserve or the balance is insufficient, the carrying amount is written down against the service line in the **Comprehensive Income and Expenditure Statement**.
  
- **Grant income** is accounted for based on whether the council is acting as:
  - **Principal**: Grant income is recorded in the Comprehensive Income and Expenditure Statement (CIES), as the council retains the risks and rewards of the income.
  - **Agent**: Grant income is not recorded in the CIES, as the council acts as an intermediary for Scottish Government or other grant bodies.

- **Capital Fund balance as of 31 March 2024**: **£28.3 million**, reflecting the council's prudent management of assets and borrowing decisions in alignment with the Best Value framework.

### Page 49

#### Summary:
Page 49 provides further explanation on **financial instruments** and their recognition on the council’s balance sheet. It outlines how financial liabilities and assets are measured, how interest is calculated, and the method used to recognize debtors. Additionally, it addresses how expected credit losses are recognized and how fair value measurements are categorized for non-financial assets.

#### Detailed Statistics:

- **Financial liabilities** are measured at amortized cost, with the balance sheet showing the **outstanding principal** repayable, including **accrued interest**.
- **Effective interest rate**: The interest payable is calculated using the effective interest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future payments over the life of the financial instrument to the amount originally recognized.
  
- **Debtors** represent the current value of outstanding amounts owed to the council. These are recognized at the **current value** of outstanding assets.
  
- **Expected credit losses**: The council recognizes expected credit losses on all its financial assets held at amortized cost. For **trade receivables**, only **lifetime losses** are recognized. Impairment losses reflect the expectation that future cash flows may not occur because the borrower might default. Losses are assessed based on:
  - **Lifetime expected losses** when credit risk has increased significantly.
  - **12-month expected losses** when credit risk has not significantly increased.

- **Fair value measurement**: The council categorizes non-financial assets, such as surplus assets not yet held for sale, into three levels:
  - **Level 1**: Quoted prices in active markets.
  - **Level 2**: Observable inputs other than quoted prices.
  - **Level 3**: Unobservable inputs.

### Page 50

#### Summary:
Page 50 explains **Note 2 – Accounting Standards Issued, Not Yet Adopted**. This page discusses new accounting standards and amendments that have been issued but are not yet adopted by the council for the financial year ending 31 March 2024. These changes may affect the council’s financial reporting in future years, particularly around leases and service concessions.

#### Detailed Statistics:

- **IFRS 16 Leases**: This standard has been delayed for implementation until **1 April 2024**. It requires lessees to recognize all leases (except short-term and low-value leases) on the balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. Currently, these leases are classified as operating leases and not shown on the balance sheet.
  
- **Other financial reporting amendments** that are expected to impact future statements include:
  - Amendments to **IAS 37 – Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets**: This amendment clarifies the costs a company should include when assessing if a contract is onerous.
  - Amendments to **IAS 16 – Property, Plant, and Equipment**: Clarifies the treatment of proceeds before intended use. This may impact the recognition of income or expenditure when new property or equipment is brought into service.
  
- The financial impact of these changes is still being assessed, but they are expected to alter how leases and certain provisions are reported in future accounts.

### Page 51

  ### Page 52

#### Summary:
Page 52 introduces **Note 2 - Accounting Standards Issued, Not Yet Adopted**. This section lists new or amended accounting standards that have been issued but not yet adopted by the council. These standards will impact the financial statements in future periods. The page also provides some commentary on the potential impact of these changes, particularly in areas such as leases, employee benefits, and service concessions.

#### Detailed Statistics:

- **IFRS 16 Leases**: Implementation deferred to **1 April 2024**. This standard changes how lessees recognize leases by including nearly all leases on the balance sheet as a **right-of-use asset** and a corresponding lease liability. The council has noted that this change could have a material impact on their financial position once adopted.
  
- **Other new standards**:
  - Amendments to **IAS 37 – Provisions, Contingent Liabilities, and Contingent Assets** clarify which costs to include when determining if a contract is onerous.
  - Amendments to **IAS 16 – Property, Plant, and Equipment** focus on proceeds from selling items produced while preparing an asset for its intended use, affecting how revenue and costs are recognized during this period.

- The council anticipates that these standards will not have a significant impact on its 2023/24 financial statements but acknowledges that further assessments will be required once fully implemented.

### Page 53

#### Summary:
Page 53 covers **Note 3 – Critical Judgements in Applying Accounting Policies**. This section discusses the council’s key judgements and estimates that were necessary for applying accounting policies. The focus is on areas where the council had to exercise significant discretion, particularly regarding asset valuations, provisions, and leases.

#### Detailed Statistics:

- **Asset Valuations**: The council uses the **Beacon Principle** for council housing, a method of valuing social housing. This is based on guidance from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS).
  
- **PPP (Public-Private Partnership) Service Concessions**: Flexibility applied to service concession contracts before **1 April 2022** (as per Scottish Government Finance Circular 10/2022) led to a retrospective adjustment of **£3.277 million** for the year 2023/24.

- **Fair Value of Financial Instruments**: The council determines the fair value of certain financial instruments, and these are categorized using a three-level hierarchy (Level 1: observable prices in active markets; Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices; Level 3: unobservable inputs).

### Page 54

**Summary:**
Page 54 of the document outlines significant assumptions and uncertainties that affect the council's financial estimations for future periods. It specifically addresses estimation risks related to life expectancy, pension obligations, the valuation of assets, and debtors.

**Key Statistics:**

1. **Pension Liability Sensitivity:**
   - A one-year increase in life expectancy would raise the Employer’s Defined Benefit Obligation by approximately 3-5%, translating to an increase of **£32 million to £55 million**.
   - The exact cost depends on the structure of the assumption changes, particularly which age groups see improvements in survival rates.

2. **Fair Value of Assets:**
   - The council held **£0.337 billion** in surplus assets not available for sale, Level 2 and Level 3 financial instruments, and pension plan assets as of 31 March 2024.
   - Fair value is subject to significant estimation uncertainty as these assets lack quoted market prices and rely on observable data where possible.

3. **Debtors and Allowances for Doubtful Debts:**
   - As of 31 March 2024, the council had a balance of debtors totaling **£45.7 million**:
     - **£13 million** in accounts receivable.

- **Credit Risk Management:**
  - The council mitigates credit risk by assessing credit exposure on a 12-month basis for all financial assets held at amortised cost. Lifetime expected credit losses are recognized for trade receivables (debtors) to safeguard against potential defaults.
  - **Inputs for Fair Value Measurement:**
    - **Level 1:** Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
    - **Level 2:** Observable inputs for the asset or liability other than quoted prices (e.g., bond market data).
    - **Level 3:** Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, used when market data is not available.

- **Expected Credit Losses:**
  - Credit risk is evaluated using factors such as significant increases in risk since initial recognition. Only where risk remains low are losses assessed on a 12-month basis; otherwise, they are on a lifetime basis.
  - This approach ensures that financial instruments such as trade receivables (debtors) reflect a prudent assessment of future cash flow risks, enhancing the council's financial resilience.

These financial management strategies underscore the council’s commitment to responsible fiscal oversight, providing clear mechanisms to manage risks, assess fair values, and ensure that liabilities and assets are reported accurately in compliance with standards.
