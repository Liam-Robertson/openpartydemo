- **Chief Executive, Finance, and Property Services:** Due to the significant expenditure (£132.021 million) in this category, and without detailed breakdowns, we have included it under **Corporate and Central Services**.

- **Operational Services Breakdown:** The Operational Services expenditure (£92.841 million) likely includes waste disposal, road maintenance, and other environmental services, but specific allocations were not provided. Therefore, it is categorized under **Environmental and Operational Services** as a whole.

- **Other Services:** This category remains broad due to the lack of detailed information. It includes various essential services that support the community and may encompass elements of social support, economic development, and administrative functions.

- **Minor Expenditures:** Small expenditures have been grouped under **Miscellaneous Expenditures** as per your request, to maintain focus on significant spending areas.
