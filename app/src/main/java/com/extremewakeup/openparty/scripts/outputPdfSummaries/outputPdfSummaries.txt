### Title: Page 14

### Detailed Summary:
This section continues discussing the audit of West Lothian Council’s 2023/24 annual accounts. It elaborates on the public's rights to inspect and object to the council’s accounts and the auditor's application of materiality concepts in reviewing the accounts.

**Key Aspects**:
- **Public Inspection Rights**: The Local Government (Scotland) Act of 1973 grants the public the right to inspect and object to the accounts of a local authority. For the 2023/24 annual accounts, no objections were raised during the inspection period.
  
- **Materiality**: Materiality is a concept auditors use to determine whether a misstatement in the financial statements is significant enough to influence economic decisions by the users of those financial statements. Auditors use a monetary threshold to guide their decisions regarding materiality, but some issues might be considered material by nature. The auditor’s professional judgment plays a central role in determining materiality.

- **Initial Materiality Assessment**: The initial assessment of materiality was conducted during the audit’s risk assessment phase and adjusted when the unaudited annual accounts were received.

**Materiality Values** (Exhibit 1):
- **Overall Materiality**:
  - West Lothian Council: £19.5 million
  - Group: £23.1 million
- **Performance Materiality** (set at 75% of overall materiality):
  - West Lothian Council: £14.5 million
  - Group: £17.3 million
- **Reporting Threshold** (any misstatements above this threshold must be corrected):
  - West Lothian Council and Group: £0.5 million

Auditors use performance materiality to evaluate individual areas within the financial statements, applying a more conservative threshold to minimize the risk of aggregate errors exceeding overall materiality. Historically, West Lothian Council has had a low number of errors or significant issues, justifying the 75% performance materiality level.

Auditors are obligated to request that all misstatements exceeding the reporting threshold be corrected, but the final decision on whether to make corrections lies with the council's governing body.

### Statistics:
- **No objections** were raised regarding the 2023/24 annual accounts.
- **Materiality for West Lothian Council**:
  - Overall materiality: £19.5 million
  - Performance materiality: £14.5 million
  - Reporting threshold: £0.5 million
- **Materiality for Group**:
  - Overall materiality: £23.1 million
  - Performance materiality: £17.3 million
  - Reporting threshold: £0.5 million

### Title: Page 15

### Detailed Summary:
This section covers the significant findings and key audit matters related to the 2023/24 audit of West Lothian Council's annual accounts. The findings are communicated under the requirements of **ISA (UK) 260**, which mandates reporting on significant audit matters to the council. The auditor also highlights key audit matters under **ISA (UK) 701**, which are issues deemed most significant during the audit.

**Significant Finding**:
One key issue identified in the audit was related to the **treatment of unfunded pension liabilities**. The audit team confirmed that appropriate adjustments had been made by West Lothian Council, resolving the issue.

### Risks of Material Misstatement:
The audit focused on identifying risks that could lead to material misstatements in the council's financial statements. The auditors addressed these risks through specific procedures aimed at obtaining assurances. **Exhibit 2** details the main risks identified and the procedures performed to mitigate them.

#### **Exhibit 2: Significant Risks of Material Misstatement in the Annual Accounts**

1. **Risk of Material Misstatement due to Fraud Caused by Management Override of Controls**:
   - **Audit Risk**: Management is in a unique position to commit fraud by overriding controls that are otherwise effective. This risk is recognized in **ISA (UK) 240**.
   - **Controls Assessed**: The design and implementation of controls over journal entry processing were evaluated.
   - **Methodology and Assumptions**: The audit examined any changes to the methods and assumptions used by management in preparing accounting estimates compared to the prior year.
   - **Testing Conducted**:
     - Inquiries were made with relevant officers to detect any unusual or inappropriate activities related to journal entries.
     - Substantive testing of journal entries throughout the year was conducted.
     - Significant transactions outside the normal course of business were evaluated.
     - Income and expenditure transactions around the year-end were tested to ensure they were accounted for in the correct financial year.
     - Samples of accruals and prepayments were tested.
     - The process for identifying and disclosing related parties was reviewed.

This process aimed to mitigate the risk of misstatement due to fraud or management’s ability to manipulate financial figures by overriding existing controls.

### Statistics:
- **Key Audit Findings**: One significant issue regarding the treatment of unfunded pension liabilities, which was appropriately adjusted.
- **Material Misstatement Risk**: Procedures included testing journal entries, evaluating transactions outside normal operations, and reviewing the processes for related-party disclosures. No specific numbers were provided in this section, but the key risks and the methodology for mitigating them were thoroughly described.

### Title: Page 16

### Detailed Summary:
This section continues the discussion of significant audit risks and findings from the 2023/24 audit of West Lothian Council’s annual accounts, with a focus on two key risks: the valuation of land and buildings, and the valuation of pension assets and liabilities.

#### **2. Estimation in the Valuation of Land and Buildings**:
The valuation of land and buildings poses a significant risk due to the high degree of subjectivity involved. Valuations are based on specialist assumptions, which can lead to material changes. All non-current assets are revalued on a five-year rolling basis, but changes in asset values from year to year must be reflected accurately in the financial statements. Furthermore, West Lothian Council must ensure that assets not revalued in the year are not materially misstated.

The audit team took several steps to assess this risk, including:
- **Controls**: Evaluating the council’s approach to determining whether assets not valued in the current year were materially misstated.
- **Management Experts**: Assessing the competence, capabilities, and objectivity of the professional valuers.
- **Methodology and Assumptions**: Ensuring valuations were conducted according to RICS Valuation Professional Standards ("Red Book") and testing the reasonableness of assumptions used by valuers.
- **Testing**: Reconciling the financial ledger with the asset register and testing a sample of land and building assets revalued in the year.
- **Disclosures**: Evaluating the adequacy of disclosures regarding assumptions made in the valuation of land and buildings.

**Conclusion**: The audit concluded that the current valuation of land and buildings was not materially misstated.

#### **3. Area of Audit Focus – Valuation of Pension Asset or Liability**:
The valuation of pension assets and liabilities requires complex actuarial methods based on various financial and demographic assumptions. These calculations are highly sensitive to the assumptions used, which can result in significant changes in the valuation of pension-related figures.

The audit approach included:
- Assessing the scope, independence, and competence of the professionals involved in making these estimates.
- Reviewing the appropriateness of actuarial assumptions, including comparisons with other councils to ensure consistency.

### Statistics:
- **Risk of material misstatement due to land and building valuations**: Addressed by evaluating methodology, assumptions, and testing the reconciliation between the ledger and asset register.
- **No material misstatements** were identified in the valuation of land and buildings.
- **Valuation of Pension Asset or Liability**: This was flagged as an area of audit focus, requiring the use of actuarial methodologies based on financial and demographic assumptions. The audit team reviewed assumptions and compared them to those used by other councils to ensure consistency and appropriateness.

### Title: Page 17

### Detailed Summary:
This section continues addressing the valuation and treatment of pension assets, liabilities, and other areas of review, including preparations for the implementation of **IFRS 16** (International Financial Reporting Standard 16, Leases) and infrastructure asset valuation.

#### **Pension Asset and Unfunded Pension Liabilities**:
In 2023/24, the actuary calculated a pension asset for West Lothian Council. However, an asset ceiling was applied, resulting in a nil balance recognized in the accounts, consistent with the approach in 2022/23.

A key audit focus was on the **unfunded pension liabilities**, which include provisions for discretionary retirement benefits (such as early retirement payments made by the council rather than the pension fund). Under **IAS 19**, these are treated as termination benefits, and the audit team identified that these unfunded liabilities should be presented separately from the net defined benefit asset or liability. West Lothian Council updated its accounts accordingly, presenting the unfunded liability separately on the balance sheet and restating the prior year for consistency. The audit team reviewed and was satisfied with these adjustments.

#### **Further Areas of Review**:
As part of the risk assessment outlined in the Annual Audit Plan, additional areas were identified for review. These were not considered audit risks but were monitored throughout the process:

1. **Implementation of IFRS 16 (Leases)**:
   - IFRS 16 will change how local government bodies account for operating leases by requiring the recognition of assets and liabilities for rights and obligations related to leases previously classified as operating leases. This new standard will be applied starting from 1 April 2024.
   - The council has already identified relevant operating leases and confirmed the amounts that will be included in the 2024/25 accounts under **right-of-use assets** and **lease liabilities**. The values are not considered material. The audit team reviewed the council’s work and approach, and they are satisfied with the council’s preparations for IFRS 16 implementation.

2. **Statutory Override on Infrastructure Assets**:
   - Since 2021/22, a temporary statutory override has been in place to address technical accounting issues with the valuation of infrastructure assets across the UK. These overrides were due to expire on 31 March 2024. The council will need to monitor developments regarding the statutory override to ensure compliance with future reporting requirements.

### Statistics:
- **Pension asset valuation**: Calculated as nil due to the application of the asset ceiling.
- **Unfunded pension liability**: Separated from the net defined benefit asset or liability and presented independently on the balance sheet, with prior-year restatements for consistency.
- **IFRS 16 (Leases)**: The council will recognize assets and liabilities related to operating leases starting 1 April 2024, but the values are not material.

### Title: Page 18

### Detailed Summary:
This section of the report continues addressing the accounting and audit findings related to infrastructure assets, the identification of misstatements, and overall audit processes for West Lothian Council's 2023/24 annual accounts.

#### **Infrastructure Assets**:
Infrastructure assets (e.g., carriageways, street lighting, traffic systems) are inalienable assets that are measured at historical cost under the accounting code. A significant challenge arises when replacing components of these assets because the old components must be derecognized from the financial records. Failure to do so can lead to double-counting and an overstatement of the gross book value, accumulated depreciation, and net book value of these assets.

The Scottish Government initially issued a temporary **statutory override** (Finance Circular 9/2022) for the 2022/23 and 2023/24 financial years to address this issue. However, a permanent solution has not yet been reached, and Finance Circular 8/2024 extended the statutory override into the 2024/25 financial year. West Lothian Council applied both statutory overrides in the 2023/24 accounts, and the audit team will continue monitoring the situation as further actions may be required once a permanent solution is implemented.

#### **Misstatements**:
- **One misstatement** was identified in the 2023/24 audit, totaling **£20.0 million** (prior year: **£21.7 million**). This misstatement exceeded the performance materiality threshold.
- The misstatement was related to the unfunded element of the pension liability (previously discussed in paragraph 23), and it was determined that this was an isolated issue rather than a systemic error. Further audit procedures were considered but deemed unnecessary, as the misstatement did not indicate a broader material risk.
- Several presentational and disclosure amendments were discussed and agreed with management. These amendments were satisfactory.

#### **Timely Submission of Unaudited Accounts**:
The unaudited annual accounts were submitted in line with the agreed audit timetable on **30 June 2024**. The working papers provided were of high quality, and the finance team, along with other council staff, offered good support to the audit team, ensuring that the audit process ran smoothly.

### Statistics:
- **Statutory override for infrastructure assets**: Applied for 2022/23 and 2023/24 and extended to 2024/25 via Finance Circular 8/2024.
- **Misstatement identified**: £20.0 million in 2023/24 (compared to £21.7 million in the prior year).
- **Unaudited accounts submission date**: 30 June 2024, with supporting documents provided at a high standard.

### Title: Page 19

### Detailed Summary:
This section covers the audit of charitable trusts under **Section 106** of the Local Government in Scotland Act 1973, which are administered by West Lothian Council. These charitable trusts are registered with the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator and require a separate independent auditor's report for each trust.

#### **Audit of Section 106 Charities**:
- The appointments of auditors by the Accounts Commission to councils also cover trust funds or Common Good funds that are registered charities under Section 106. Even if the charity is small, an independent audit is required when members of West Lothian Council serve as sole trustees.
  
- West Lothian Council manages **nine such charitable trusts**, each of which is required to prepare annual reports and financial statements. These reports are subject to a full audit.

- For the 2023/24 financial year, the audit opinions on all Section 106 charities were **unmodified**, indicating that the financial statements were in accordance with the applicable accounting framework.

#### **Audit Findings**:
- The audit followed **International Standard on Auditing (UK) 260**, which involves communicating the audit team’s responses to assessed risks, as well as significant findings and the auditor’s views on qualitative aspects of accounting practices.
  
- Other than the presumed risk of **fraud due to management override of controls** (a standard risk identified in any audit), no specific risks of material misstatement were identified in relation to the 2023/24 charitable trusts' annual accounts.
  
- No significant issues were identified in the audit of these trusts.

### Statistics:
- **Number of Section 106 charitable trusts**: 9
- **Audit opinions for Section 106 charitable trusts**: Unmodified

### Title: Page 20

### Detailed Summary:
This section focuses on **financial management** within West Lothian Council for the 2023/24 financial year. Financial management refers to the effectiveness of budgetary processes, understanding the financial environment, and ensuring that internal controls are operating as expected.

#### **Conclusion**:
West Lothian Council is found to have appropriate and effective financial management in place. Regular budget monitoring reports are provided to the **Council Executive** to ensure transparency and oversight.

Despite sound financial management, the council’s core revenue outturn showed an **overspend of £2.9 million** against the agreed budget of £575.2 million for 2023/24. This overspend was covered by drawing from the **Risk and Inflation Reserve**, which had been established during budget planning in February 2023 to handle emerging financial pressures.

#### **Budget and Spending**:
- The **2023/24 budget** was set at **£575.2 million**. This included proposed savings measures amounting to **£12.1 million**, though actual approved savings were **£8.4 million** following a budget motion.
- Despite the overall budget being met, the council experienced an overspend of £2.9 million, which was funded through reserves.

#### **Exhibit 3: Summary of Significant Under/Over-spends**:
Two key areas of financial variance were highlighted:

1. **Schools, Education Support**:
   - **Budget**: £188.431 million
   - **Underspend**: £433,000
   - **Reason**: Savings primarily arose from vacant positions and the cessation of non-essential supplies. However, this was partially offset by pressures in Early Learning and Childcare.

2. **Planning, Economic Development, and Regeneration**:
   - **Budget**: £5.848 million
   - **Underspend**: £736,000
   - **Reason**: The department benefited from over-recovered income from planning applications and pest control services, as well as staff savings.

### Statistics:
- **Agreed budget for 2023/24**: £575.2 million
- **Revenue budget savings**:
  - Proposed: £12.1 million
  - Approved: £8.4 million
- **Core revenue outturn**: £2.9 million overspend
- **Funding of overspend**: From Risk and Inflation Reserve
- **Underspends**:
  - **Schools, Education Support**: £433,000
  - **Planning, Economic Development, and Regeneration**: £736,000

### Title: Page 22

### Detailed Summary:

This section of the report focuses on West Lothian Council's budget management, housing revenue account (HRA), and the movement of financial reserves for 2023/24. 

The report confirms that 98% of the council's approved budget savings for the year were achieved or considered achievable as of Month 9 in the financial year. The remaining 2% of savings, related to IJB – Adult and Elderly Services (housing benefits), were deemed unachievable, but alternative savings were found.

The Housing Revenue Account (HRA) operated within its legislative requirement to at least break even. Despite initially reporting a deficit of £25.4 million, adjustments to the accounting practices brought this to a break-even position, maintaining an HRA balance of £0.9 million.

One of the report’s key focuses is the significant movement in the council’s reserves. The General Fund reserves dropped substantially, from £57.1 million in 2022/23 to £37.2 million in 2023/24. The reduction is partly due to the use of reserves for key projects, such as repairs to St Kentigern’s school and balancing recurring budgets. Additionally, the council adjusted its service concession arrangements, which temporarily bolstered the General Fund in the previous year but will carry costs into the future.

### Detailed Statistics:

1. **Budget Savings:**
   - **2023/24 Approved Savings Achieved or Achievable**: 98%
   - **Unachievable Savings (Related to IJB – Adult and Elderly Services Housing Benefits)**: 2%
   - **Alternative savings identified**: Yes

2. **Housing Revenue Account (HRA):**
   - **Deficit Reported (2023/24)**: £25.4 million
   - **Deficit Reported (2022/23)**: £37.2 million
   - **Adjustments leading to breakeven**: Yes, adjustments between accounting and funding bases erased the £25.4 million deficit.
   - **Balance Carried Forward**: £0.9 million

3. **General Fund Reserves:**
   - **General Fund Reserves (2022/23)**: £57.1 million
   - **General Fund Reserves (2023/24)**: £37.2 million
   - **Drop in Reserves**: £19.9 million

4. **Key Reserve Utilization in 2023/24**:
   - **St Kentigern’s school works (RAAC affected building replacement)**: £8.3 million
   - **Amounts used to balance recurring revenue budgets on a one-off basis**: £7.0 million

These statistics underscore the council's efforts to manage its budget efficiently while addressing large financial pressures, such as essential infrastructure repairs and maintaining a balanced housing revenue account. The use of reserves indicates the council's strategic deployment of resources to manage short-term financial pressures but suggests future costs from adjustments to service concession arrangements.

### Title: Page 23

### Detailed Summary:

This section of the report continues to discuss West Lothian Council's financial management for the year 2023/24. It elaborates on the reserves, capital expenditure, and underspends across various services, including housing.

The report highlights that the uncommitted General Fund Balance as of March 31, 2024, is set at £2.0 million, which aligns with the council's policy of maintaining a minimum balance of £2 million to handle unforeseen events. Additionally, the council's Risk and Inflation reserve amounts to £4.1 million.

The capital expenditure for 2023/24 was lower than budgeted. Total capital spending reached £95.6 million compared to the budgeted £100.4 million. This expenditure is broken down into general services and the Housing Revenue Account (HRA). General services spending exceeded its budget slightly, but the HRA underspent due to factors like industrial action, changes in project scope due to the identification of Reinforced Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (RAAC), and a lack of supplier interest for tenders.

### Detailed Statistics:

1. **Risk and Inflation Reserve**: 
   - **Amount**: £4.1 million

2. **Uncommitted General Fund Balance**: 
   - **Set Minimum Balance for 2023/24**: £2 million
   - **Actual Uncommitted Balance (as of March 31, 2024)**: £2.0 million

3. **Total Capital Expenditure (2023/24)**: 
   - **Budgeted**: £100.4 million
   - **Actual Expenditure**: £95.6 million
   - **Underspend**: £4.8 million

4. **Breakdown of Capital Expenditure**:
   - **General Services Budget**: £72.2 million
   - **General Services Actual Expenditure**: £75.1 million
   - **General Services Overspend**: £2.9 million
   - **Housing Revenue Account (HRA) Budget**: £23.4 million
   - **Housing Revenue Account (HRA) Actual Expenditure**: £15.8 million
   - **HRA Underspend**: £7.6 million

5. **Reasons for HRA Underspend**:
   - **Industrial Action**: Delayed several housing projects.
   - **RAAC**: Identified in certain properties, altering the scope of works.
   - **Lack of Supplier Interest**: Tender exercises for some projects failed to attract interest.

This detailed breakdown shows how the council managed its reserves and capital expenditure, carefully navigating through industrial delays and project scope adjustments while maintaining the required reserve levels for financial security.

   - Internal controls, including those relating to IT systems, were deemed appropriate for financial recording and reporting.

6. **Fraud and Error Prevention**:
   - The council’s systems for preventing fraud, error, bribery, and corruption were found to be effective, particularly concerning areas like tax receipts, welfare benefits, and grant claims.

This summary illustrates West Lothian Council's careful management of capital investments and debt, maintaining financial controls and safeguarding public resources through robust internal control and audit systems.

### Title: Page 25

### Detailed Summary:

This section of the report focuses on West Lothian Council's efforts to prevent and detect fraud, highlighting their participation in the National Fraud Initiative (NFI) in Scotland. The NFI is a counter-fraud initiative run by Audit Scotland, which uses data matching to detect potential fraud or irregularities across public bodies.

The council actively participates in this initiative, receiving data matches for investigation. These matches are categorized by risk level, with recommended matches and other relevant ones being thoroughly investigated. The council has established processes in place to address any issues that arise from these matches. For the current NFI exercise, running over 2022/23 and 2023/24, no significant issues were identified. The outcomes of these investigations are reported to the audit committee.

### Detailed Statistics:

1. **National Fraud Initiative (NFI)**:
   - **Time Frame**: 2022/23 and 2023/24
   - **Process**: Public bodies receive data matches for investigation (starting in January 2023).
   - **Outcome**: No significant issues were identified from the data matches in the current NFI exercise.

The document reinforces West Lothian Council’s commitment to countering fraud and ensuring public resources are protected through robust investigative and reporting processes. The lack of significant issues identified in the latest fraud initiative highlights the effectiveness of their systems.

### Title: Page 26

### Detailed Summary:

This section discusses West Lothian Council’s approach to financial sustainability, focusing on long-term planning and budget strategies. Financial sustainability here is defined as the ability to meet current financial needs without compromising future generations. The council has put in place a robust framework for medium- and long-term financial planning to address ongoing challenges, aiming to achieve a break-even position each year.

In February 2024, the council updated its financial strategy to reflect emerging pressures, adopting a four-year revenue budget strategy extending to 2027/28 and detailed revenue budgets for 2024/25 to 2025/26. The four-year budget projects an overall budget gap of £38 million, with a £24.4 million gap forecast for the first two years (2024/25 to 2025/26). The council and the Integration Joint Board (IJB) have already identified £21.5 million in savings for the next two years, reducing the remaining budget gap to £2.9 million. For the full four-year period, savings of £28.5 million have been identified, leaving a residual budget gap of £9.5 million.

### Detailed Statistics:

1. **Estimated Overall Budget Gap (2024/25 to 2027/28)**:
   - **Total Four-Year Gap**: £38 million
   - **Gap for First Two Years (2024/25 to 2025/26)**: £24.4 million

2. **Budget Savings (Agreed by Council and IJB)**:
   - **Total Savings for 2024/25 to 2025/26**: £21.5 million
   - **Remaining Gap for 2024/25 to 2025/26**: £2.9 million
   - **Total Savings for the Full Four-Year Plan (2024/25 to 2027/28)**: £28.5 million
   - **Remaining Gap for 2024/25 to 2027/28**: £9.5 million

These statistics demonstrate that while West Lothian Council has identified significant savings to address financial pressures, challenges remain, particularly in closing the remaining budget gap for the next four years. The council's proactive long-term planning aims to ensure ongoing financial stability.

### Title: Page 27

### Detailed Summary:

This section of the report discusses the financial sustainability measures in West Lothian Council, with a focus on addressing forecasted budget gaps and ongoing efforts to remediate properties impacted by Reinforced Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (RAAC).

The council has clearly identified funding gaps through its medium- and long-term financial planning. It has developed savings plans that are continually monitored, with efforts to find further savings to address the remaining gaps. The report emphasizes that the use of one-off resources to balance the budget is not sustainable, and the council is exploring recurring measures, including public consultations.

Additionally, the council has undertaken a comprehensive programme to address properties affected by RAAC. RAAC was used in social housing construction in West Lothian from the 1950s to the 1980s, and it has been linked to significant structural and safety issues. The council has been proactive in managing this risk, with works completed in various sites, including schools and community centres. A notable example is the removal of RAAC from St. Kentigern's Academy, with the final phase of demolition in progress and the replacement building in the design phase.

### Detailed Statistics:

1. **Forecast Budget Gap Before Savings** (2024/25 to 2027/28):
   - **2024/25**: £16 million
   - **2025/26**: £13 million
   - **2026/27**: £12 million
   - **2027/28**: £11 million

2. **RAAC Remediation**:
   - RAAC was used in social housing in West Lothian between the **1950s and 1980s**.
   - Issues with RAAC include **moisture ingress**, **structural defects**, and potential **fire spread**.
   - Works have been completed in various sites, such as schools and community centres.
   - **St. Kentigern’s Academy**: RAAC has been removed, and the final phase of demolition is in progress, with the replacement building currently in the design phase.

These statistics show that while West Lothian Council is facing substantial budget challenges, it is taking proactive steps through long-term planning and savings strategies. Additionally, the council's handling of RAAC-related issues demonstrates its commitment to safety and asset management.

### Title: Page 28

### Detailed Summary:

This section covers West Lothian Council's work on identifying and remediating Reinforced Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (RAAC) in housing stock, as well as the financial impact of the most recent pensions triennial funding valuation. 

The council assessed its housing stock, which consists of 14,000 properties, to identify any RAAC-related issues. Of these, 69 individual properties and 15 blocks of flats were found to contain RAAC, representing just 0.5% of the overall housing stock. The council has initiated a remediation strategy based on the condition of these properties, with funding included in the capital budget to address the necessary repairs.

In addition, the 2023 triennial funding valuation of the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS), to which West Lothian Council contributes via the Lothian Pension Fund (LPF), has yielded positive results. The LPF’s funding level increased significantly from 106% in 2020 to 157% in 2023, allowing for a reduction in employer contribution rates. This will help alleviate financial pressures for the council. Employer contributions will drop from 21.8% to 17.6%, a change that has already been factored into the council’s 2024/25 budget plans.

### Detailed Statistics:

1. **RAAC in Housing Stock**:
   - **Total Housing Stock**: 14,000 properties, including 427 common blocks
   - **RAAC Found in**: 69 individual properties and 15 blocks of flats
   - **Percentage of Housing Stock with RAAC**: 0.5%
   - **Remediation Strategy**: Implemented, with capital funding allocated for 2023/24 to carry out necessary works.

2. **Lothian Pension Fund (LPF) – Triennial Funding Valuation**:
   - **Valuation Date**: 31 March 2023
   - **Funding Level (2023)**: 157%
   - **Funding Level (2020)**: 106%
   - **Employer Contribution Rate (Before April 2024)**: 21.8%
   - **Employer Contribution Rate (From April 2024)**: 17.6%
   - **Impact on 2024/25 Budget**: Reduced pension contribution costs are incorporated into financial plans for 2024/25.

This section highlights the council's proactive approach to addressing RAAC-related issues and the financial benefits resulting from improved pension fund health. The significant drop in pension contribution rates will provide a financial reprieve in the upcoming budget year.

     - **Reason**: Savings from staff vacancies ahead of restructuring and higher than expected intervention income.

4. **Non-Service Expenditure**:
   - **Overspend**: £2.279 million
     - **Breakdown**:
       - **Council Tax Reduction Scheme (CTRS)**: £1.019 million overspend due to higher caseloads and increased award levels.
       - **Equal Pay Provision**: Remaining balance of £165,000 after final payments were made by March 2024, helping to offset other costs.

   - The council is closely monitoring the broader economic and funding environment, especially given inflation risks and the economic outlook for both the UK and Scotland.

2. **Risk Management and Governance:**
   - **High Risks:** The council regularly updates its Governance and Risk Committee, Board, and Executive Management Team (EMT) on high risks, which include ongoing controls and further risk mitigation actions.
   - **Strategic Risks:** These are critical risks that could significantly impact the council's ability to meet objectives, covering economic uncertainties, health and safety, compliance, and business continuity.

   - **Demand-Led Services:** Increased costs in these areas, beyond forecasts, would place further strain on finances.
   - **Inflation:** Assumptions about inflation are constantly revised based on multiple indices (e.g., utilities, fuel, food), with specific concerns over contract inflation for sectors like transport.
   - **Homeless Services:** The council is struggling to meet statutory obligations for homelessness within its budget, despite increasing support and expanding social housing. Construction for a new young persons' homeless unit in Livingston will begin in 2024/25.

### Summary:
This section of the document focuses on various **Notes to the Annual Accounts**, including the council's treatment of revenue transactions, accounting for property, plant, and equipment (PPE), depreciation policies, and the valuation and revaluation process for these assets. It also covers accounting for intangible assets such as software and licenses, as well as the treatment of capital receipts from the sale of assets.

The policies and methodologies applied in the council’s accounting practices align with international standards and the Code of Practice on Local Authority Accounting, ensuring compliance and proper reporting of financial data.

---

### Detailed Statistics:

1. **Revenue Transactions:**
   - The council's revenue accounts operate on an accruals basis, meaning transactions are recorded when they occur, regardless of whether cash has been received or paid. 
   - Provisions for bad or doubtful debts have been included in both the General Fund and Housing Revenue Account.
   - There is no minimum threshold (de minimis level) for including revenue transactions in the accounts.

2. **Depreciation of Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE):**
   - Under IAS 16, major components of assets with a cost significant to the total are depreciated separately. The significance threshold is set at **£100,000** for assets with a value over **£1.5 million** in 2023/24 (**£1 million** in 2022/23).
   - Depreciation of various assets is done on a straight-line basis over the following useful lives:
     - Council dwellings: **50 years**.
     - Fixtures in council dwellings: **27 years**.
     - Operational buildings: **20–60 years**.
     - Plant and equipment (other): **10–25 years**.
     - Plant and equipment (books): **3 years**.
     - Motor vehicles: **4–10 years**.
     - Fixtures and fittings: **3–10 years**.
     - Infrastructure assets: **40 years**.
   - No depreciation is applied to community assets, assets under construction, surplus assets not available for sale, or heritage assets.

3. **Revaluation of Property, Plant, and Equipment:**
   - In 2023/24, properties and other assets, such as cemetery land, grass pitches, and pavilions, underwent revaluation. This resulted in:
     - A **£17.7 million** charge to the Comprehensive Income and Expenditure Statement.
     - A **£38.8 million** credit to the Revaluation Reserve.
     - Net upward revaluation of **£21.1 million**.
   - Revaluation adjustments did not affect the General Fund Balance.

4. **Depreciation of Revalued Properties:**
   - Assets that were revalued in 2023/24 had their useful lives updated. Depreciation was applied on a componentized basis for these assets.

5. **Quinquennial Revaluation Policy:**
   - The council continues with its policy of quinquennial (every five years) revaluation but updates only the useful lives of assets acquired, enhanced, or revalued during the year.

6. **Valuation of Council Dwellings:**
   - Fixtures within council dwellings are depreciated over **27 years**, while the non-fixture parts are depreciated over **50 years**.

7. **Valuation of Intangible Assets:**
   - Intangible assets, such as software, are treated similarly to PPE and amortized over three years on a straight-line basis.

8. **Capital Receipts:**
   - Proceeds from the sale of PPE are credited to capital receipts and used to finance new capital expenditure. These transactions are credited to the capital adjustment account.

### Summary:
This section of the document continues the **Notes to the Annual Accounts**, focusing on the treatment of property, plant, and equipment (PPE), impairment, heritage assets, cash equivalents, and grants. It outlines the council's methods for managing impairments, charging revenue accounts for the use of assets, handling heritage assets, and processing grants and contributions. Additionally, it provides details on the council's debt management through the Consolidated Loans Fund and the treatment of cash and cash equivalents.

---

### Detailed Statistics:

1. **Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE) - Impairment:**
   - If an asset's value decreases (impairment), it is accounted for by either:
     - Writing down the asset's carrying amount against any balance in the Revaluation Reserve (up to the amount of accumulated gains).
     - If the Revaluation Reserve has insufficient balance, the asset is written down against the relevant service line in the Comprehensive Income and Expenditure Statement.

2. **Grant Income - Agency and Principal Treatment:**
   - **Agency:** If the council acts as an agent distributing funds on behalf of the Scottish Government, the grant income and related expenses are not included in the Comprehensive Income and Expenditure Statement (CIES).
   - **Principal:** If the council acts on its own behalf (as principal), grant income is recorded in the CIES. Grants with unsatisfied conditions are not credited until conditions are met.
   - Grants related to revenue and capital are handled according to specific rules, ensuring proper accounting of unused grants as creditors until conditions are satisfied.

3. **Redemption of Debt:**
   - The council operates a **Consolidated Loans Fund**, where all loans raised are pooled and have a repayment period of **35 years**.
   - Premiums and discounts on debt rescheduling are transferred to the **Financial Instruments Adjustment Account**, with annual charges managed through movements in the reserves.

4. **Cash and Cash Equivalents:**
   - Cash is defined as cash in hand and deposits with financial institutions that are repayable without penalty within **24 hours**.
   - **Cash equivalents** are short-term investments maturing within **three months or less** and are readily convertible to cash with little risk of value change.
   - Cash and cash equivalents are presented net of any bank overdrafts repayable on demand.

5. **Charges to Revenue Accounts for PPE:**
   - Revenue accounts, including the Housing Revenue Account (HRA), are charged with capital costs related to PPE assets, covering annual depreciation.

6. **Heritage Assets:**
   - Heritage assets, held for cultural, environmental, or historical significance, are recognized on the balance sheet if their cost or value is known.
   - Categories include **Artworks and Sculptures**, and **Civic Regalia** such as precious metals, fabric items, and robes.
   - The collection was last valued by **Bonhams** (Fine Art Auctioneers and Valuers) on March 31, 2022, with valuations updated every five years (quinquennial basis).
   - No acquisitions, donations, or disposals of heritage assets occurred during 2023/24.

7. **Improvement Grants:**
   - All expenditures on improvement and other grants are charged to revenue in the year the expenditure occurs.

8. **Government Grants and Contributions:**
   - Government grants are recorded on an accruals basis. Revenue grants are credited to the appropriate revenue account, while capital grants and contributions for PPE are credited to the Comprehensive Income and Expenditure Statement and then reversed out to the Capital Adjustment Account via the Movement in Reserves Statement.

### Summary:
This section provides detailed notes on **Financial Instruments** used by the council, including the recognition, measurement, and accounting treatment of financial liabilities, assets, and related items such as debtors, creditors, and investments. It outlines the council's approach to measuring financial assets and liabilities at amortized cost, fair value, and their treatment in the Comprehensive Income and Expenditure Statement. It also touches on the impairment of assets, expected credit loss models, and the classification of financial assets based on their business model and cash flow characteristics.

---

### Detailed Statistics:

1. **Financial Liabilities:**
   - Financial liabilities are recognized on the Balance Sheet when the council enters into a contract.
   - These are initially measured at **fair value** and carried at **amortized cost**.
   - Interest payable is calculated using the **effective interest rate** (EIR) for each instrument and recorded in the **Financing and Investment Income and Expenditure** line of the Comprehensive Income and Expenditure Statement.
   - **Borrowing** is presented in the Balance Sheet as the outstanding principal, and interest charges reflect the loan agreements.

2. **Debtors (Receivables):**
   - Recognized when goods or services are provided by the council, representing the current value of outstanding debts.
   - The **Expected Credit Loss (ECL) Model** is used to recognize potential credit losses on all financial assets held at amortized cost. For trade receivables (debtors), **lifetime losses** are recognized.
   - Losses are assessed based on credit risk, and if the risk increases, losses are evaluated on a lifetime basis. Otherwise, losses are based on a 12-month expectation.

3. **Fair Value Measurement:**
   - The council measures non-financial assets and financial instruments at fair value using valuation techniques.
   - Valuation inputs are categorized into a **fair value hierarchy**:
     - **Level 1:** Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets/liabilities.
     - **Level 2:** Observable inputs other than quoted prices (e.g., market data).
     - **Level 3:** Unobservable inputs (e.g., internal estimates).
   - **Financial Assets Measured at Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVPL):**
     - Recognized at fair value when the council becomes a party to the contract, with gains and losses recognized in the **Surplus or Deficit on the Provision of Services**.

4. **Creditors (Payables):**
   - Recognized when goods or services are received by the council but not yet paid for.
   - Creditors are recorded in the Balance Sheet at their current value (as a proxy for amortized cost).

5. **Financial Assets - Investments:**
   - The classification of financial assets depends on the business model for holding them and their cash flow characteristics. There are three categories:
     - **Amortized cost:** Held to collect contractual cash flows (principal and interest).
     - **Fair value through profit or loss (FVPL).**
     - **Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).**
   - The council primarily holds investments classified at **amortized cost** unless the asset's cash flows do not match a basic debt instrument's pattern.

6. **Financial Assets Measured at Amortized Cost:**
   - These assets are recognized at fair value upon contract creation and then measured at amortized cost.
   - Interest receivable is based on the asset's carrying amount and the effective interest rate.

### Summary:
This section of the **Notes to the Annual Accounts** focuses on several key financial elements, including the council's equity investment in Lothian Buses Limited, various financial reserves, and accounting treatment for contracts, inventories, and central support services. It also covers how revenue from contracts is recognized, how finance leases are classified, and the treatment of financial instruments and reserves, including the General Fund, Insurance Fund, and Capital Fund.

---

### Detailed Statistics:

1. **Financial Assets Measured at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI):**
   - The council holds an equity investment in **Lothian Buses Limited**, classified under **FVOCI**. 
   - Gains or losses from this investment are held in the **Financial Instrument Revaluation Reserve**.
   - This investment is measured at **Level 2** on the fair value hierarchy, using the share price multiplied by the council's shareholding.

2. **External Interest Payable:**
   - Interest is charged to the Income and Expenditure Account using the **amortized cost** method over the life of the loan.
   - For stepped **LOBO loans**, differences between coupon rates and amounts charged to the account are transferred to the **Financial Instruments Adjustment Account**.

3. **Financial Instrument Revaluation Reserve (FIRR):**
   - Represents gains arising from increases in the value of the council’s investments measured at FVOCI. The balance decreases when investments are impaired or disposed of, and gains are realized.

4. **Capital Adjustment Account:**
   - Accumulates the write-down of fixed assets due to depreciation or impairment, offset by resources set aside for financing capital expenditure.

5. **Inventories:**
   - Inventories are recorded at **average cost**, except for Deer and Highland Cows in 2022/23, which were valued at **net realizable value** under **IAS 41 - Agriculture**.
   - There was **no stock of Deer or Highland Cows** in 2023/24.

6. **Central Support Services:**
   - Costs are allocated to direct services based on various factors such as the number of employees or actual usage for postal services and telephones.
   - Charges to the **Housing Revenue Account (HRA)** and Building Services are fixed at the start of the financial year.

7. **Revenue from Contracts with Customers (IFRS 15):**
   - The council uses a **five-step approach** to assess contract income: 
     1. Identify the contract.
     2. Identify performance obligations.
     3. Determine the contract price.
     4. Allocate the contract price.
     5. Recognize revenue when obligations are satisfied.
   - No material changes were required for revenue recognition after reviewing the council's income streams.

8. **Finance Leases:**
   - **Leases** are classified based on whether they transfer substantial risks and rewards of ownership. 
   - If a lease does, it is classified as a **finance lease**; otherwise, it is considered an **operating lease**.

9. **Reserves:**
   - **General Fund:** The minimum uncommitted balance is **£2 million**.
   - **Insurance Fund:** Covers known insurance liabilities, with triennial independent valuations.
   - **Capital Fund:** Used to ensure capital programme management is based on Best Value principles. The balance in the Capital Fund as of **March 31, 2024**, was **£28.306 million**.

10. **Revaluation Reserve:**
    - Represents the net increase in the value of fixed assets as a result of revaluation, rather than their historical cost.

---

This section outlines the council's financial management practices, emphasizing fair value assessments, revenue recognition, inventory valuation, and reserve management to maintain fiscal stability and compliance with international accounting standards.

**Title: Page 121**

**Detailed Summary:**

This document, Page 121, presents notes to the annual accounts with a focus on various financial aspects, including finance leases, employee benefits, termination benefits, and service concessions.

1. **Finance Leases**: 
   Assets acquired through finance leases are capitalized along with a corresponding liability for outstanding rentals. The payments are split between finance charges and the reduction of the lease obligation, with the finance charge being recognized as revenue over the lease term.

2. **Employee Benefits**: 
   The cost of holiday entitlements earned by employees but not taken by year-end is charged to services. These entitlements can be carried over to the next financial year. The charges are at the rates applicable for the following year, and this cost is reversed out of the General Fund Balance through a statutory adjustment.

3. **Termination Benefits**: 
   Termination benefits arise from decisions to end employment before the normal retirement date or from voluntary severance agreements. These costs are accrued and recorded in the Comprehensive Income and Expenditure Statement. When termination benefits involve pension enhancements, statutory adjustments are required in the Movement in Reserves Statement to reflect the actual cash payments rather than notional accounting calculations.

4. **Public Private Partnership (PPP) and Design, Build, Finance, and Maintain (DBFM)**:
   Under IFRS, PPP and DBFM contracts are recognized as property assets, with a liability for financing. Payments to contractors are allocated between operating costs, finance lease principal and interest, and capitalized lifecycle costs.

5. **Service Concessions**:
   In response to fiscal pressures related to COVID-19 recovery, the Scottish Government updated accounting guidance to allow councils to recognize principal debt repayments over the life of assets retrospectively. The council adopted the annuity method for this adjustment. A retrospective adjustment of £27.603 million was made in 2022/23, and an in-year adjustment of £3.277 million was made for 2023/24. These changes do not alter the contractual payments to the contractor but result in adjustments to the council's reserves, with the retrospective adjustment earmarked for supporting the 2023/24 to 2027/28 revenue budget.

6. **Operating Leases**:
   Current annual rentals for operating leases have been charged to revenue.

7. **Non-Domestic Rates (NDR)**:
   Local authorities act as agents for the Government when collecting NDR. As such, NDR debtors are not recognized on the balance sheet, but a creditor or debtor is recorded for amounts collected and either overpaid or underpaid to the Government.

8. **Pension Costs**:
   The council participates in two pension schemes providing defined benefits. The teacher's pension scheme is administered by the Scottish Government and treated as a defined contribution scheme under IAS 19. The costs charged to the accounts are based on contribution rates set by HM Treasury.

**Statistics:**

- **Retrospective Adjustment**: A significant adjustment of **£27.603 million** was made in 2022/23 due to changes in the accounting treatment of service concession arrangements. This adjustment does not involve any actual cash movement but rather a change in how debt repayments are accounted for.
  
- **In-year Adjustment**: An in-year adjustment of **£3.277 million** was made for 2023/24, following the same principles of service concession flexibility.
  
- **Asset Life**: The adjustments were made using an asset life assumption of **50 years** on an annuity basis.

These statistics provide key financial details about the council's fiscal adjustments and their impact on the 2023/24 accounts.

**Title: Page 122**

**Detailed Summary:**

This document continues to provide detailed notes on the council’s annual accounts, covering various financial topics, such as pension costs, contingent liabilities, provisions, VAT, and accounting standards.

1. **Pension Costs (continued)**:
   - **Other Employees**: Employees who meet certain qualifying criteria are eligible to join the Local Government Pension Scheme (administered by the City of Edinburgh as the Lothian Pension Fund). This fund is a multi-employer scheme funded through triennial actuarial valuations, and the council's share of assets and liabilities is recognized in the accounts under IAS 19.
   - **IAS 19 Accounting**: Retirement benefits are accounted for when the council commits to them, not when they are paid. The pension cost is calculated as the increase in the employer’s attributable pension liability during the year, not the cash contributions paid to the fund.
   - **Actuarial Valuation**: The 2023/24 discount rate used for the actuarial valuation was 4.8% (compared to 4.75% in 2022/23). This valuation involves updating previous triennial actuarial assessments to reflect current conditions and apportioning assets and liabilities among employers.

2. **Pension Net Asset Restriction Calculation**:
   - The council’s IAS 19 defined benefit plan surplus for 2023/24 is **£311.841 million**. 
   - Under IFRIC 14, the future contributions (net present value) are **£2.790 billion**, while future service costs are estimated at **£2.653 billion**, resulting in a **£136.7 million** surplus. However, IFRIC 14 advises that no defined benefit plan asset should be recognized in the council’s balance sheet, so no asset or liability related to pensions is reported for 2023/24 or 2022/23.

3. **Contingent Liabilities**:
   - These arise when events create a potential obligation, but the outcome is uncertain. These liabilities are disclosed in the notes but not recognized in the balance sheet. Further details are provided in Note 28.

4. **Provisions**:
   - Provisions are made when there is a legal or constructive obligation, requiring settlement through economic benefits or services. Provisions are charged as an expense when the obligation is recognized, and adjustments are made at the end of each financial year. The council has fully discharged its liabilities from provisions held in 2022/23, as detailed in Note 18.

5. **VAT**:
   - VAT is excluded from income and expenditure since it is recoverable from or payable to HMRC.

6. **Prior Period Adjustments**:
   - These adjustments occur due to changes in accounting policies and are applied retrospectively. There were no prior period adjustments in 2023/24.

7. **Accounting Standards Issued but Not Yet Adopted**:
   - The document reports on one key accounting policy change issued but not yet adopted for 2023/24: amendments to IFRS 16, which introduce new measurement requirements for lease liabilities in sale and leaseback transactions. This was issued in September 2022.

**Statistics:**

- **Discount Rate for Pension Actuarial Valuation**: The discount rate for the 2023/24 valuation was **4.8%**, slightly higher than the **4.75%** used in 2022/23.
- **Defined Benefit Plan Surplus**: The council’s IAS 19 defined benefit plan surplus is **£311.841 million** for 2023/24.
- **Net Present Value of Future Contributions**: The actuary calculated future contributions at **£2.790 billion**, while future service costs are **£2.653 billion**, leaving a surplus of **£136.7 million**. However, no asset is recognized in the balance sheet due to IFRIC 14 guidelines.

These statistics provide essential financial details related to pension costs and obligations, as well as a significant surplus identified under actuarial assessments for 2023/24.

**Title: Page 123**

**Detailed Summary:**

This document continues to provide detailed financial notes, focusing on accounting standards yet to be adopted, critical judgments, and uncertainties related to future funding.

1. **Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted**:
   - **Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (IAS 1)**: This amendment, issued in January 2020, clarifies the requirements for classifying liabilities, particularly focusing on the right to defer settlement and the impact of lending conditions.
   - **Non-current Liabilities with Covenants (IAS 1)**: Issued in October 2022, this amendment improves the disclosure of when a liability’s settlement depends on compliance with covenants.
   - **International Tax Reform (IAS 12)**: Introduced in May 2023, this amendment provides temporary exceptions to recognize deferred tax assets/liabilities related to Pillar Two taxes for multinational groups.
   - These standards will apply starting from **1 April 2024** but do not affect the 2023/24 financial year. They are also expected to have minimal impact on the 2024/25 financial statements.

2. **IFRS 16 Leases**:
   - The mandatory adoption of **IFRS 16 Leases** will take place from **1 April 2024**, replacing the previous IAS 17 Leases. This new standard will require the council to account for leases (where it is the lessee) by recognizing right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.
   - Items of low value (under £10,000) and leases that expire on or before **31 March 2024** will be exempt.
   - The impact on the balance sheet as of **1 April 2024** is expected to include:
     - **£9.2 million** added to property, plant, and equipment for right-of-use assets.
     - **£5.0 million** added to non-current creditors (lease liabilities).
     - **£3.6 million** added to current creditors (lease liabilities).

3. **Critical Judgments in Applying Accounting Policies**:
   - **PPP/DBFM Contracts**: The council applies IFRIC 12 for PPP and DBFM agreements, which results in recognizing educational establishments on the balance sheet. The net book value of these assets is **£185.9 million**, and the corresponding liability for future payments is **£275.8 million**.
   - **Uncertainty Over Future Funding**: There is significant uncertainty surrounding future funding for local governments, which may impact the council’s ability to maintain its property, plant, and equipment. Inflation rates, which are still higher than the target of 2%, are increasing costs for areas like energy and fuel. Although inflation is trending downward, the council anticipates further cost increases.
   - The council has approved a **10-year capital investment strategy** through 2032/33, which will be reviewed annually to account for potential funding uncertainties.
   - Pay awards are assumed at **3%** for all staff, starting from **August 2024** for teaching staff and **April 2024** for other staff. If pay awards exceed this assumption, it would create additional unfunded cost pressures for the council.

**Statistics:**

- **Adoption of IFRS 16 Leases**:
   - Expected balance sheet additions as of **1 April 2024** include:
     - **£9.2 million** for property, plant, and equipment (right-of-use assets).
     - **£5.0 million** for non-current creditors (lease liabilities).
     - **£3.6 million** for current creditors (lease liabilities).

- **PPP/DBFM Contracts**:
   - The council’s net book value of PPP/DBFM assets is **£185.9 million**.
   - The future payment liability under these contracts is **£275.8 million**.

- **Assumed Pay Awards**:
   - A **3%** pay award is assumed for all staff for the 2024/25 fiscal year, with effective dates of **August 2024** for teaching staff and **April 2024** for other staff.

These statistics provide important financial details regarding the impact of IFRS 16 on the council’s assets and liabilities and the financial obligations related to PPP and DBFM contracts. Additionally, the assumptions on pay awards and the uncertainty regarding future funding could significantly influence future financial planning.

**Title: Page 124**

**Detailed Summary:**

This document outlines the assumptions and uncertainties that have been made in preparing the council’s financial statements, particularly around pension liabilities, fair value measurements, and debtor balances. It highlights how changes in estimates and assumptions can significantly impact the financial results.

1. **Assumptions and Estimation Uncertainty**:
   - The council has made several assumptions about future events, particularly regarding pension obligations and other liabilities. These assumptions are based on actuarial valuations, economic factors, and historical trends. However, actual outcomes may differ significantly from these estimates.

2. **Pension Obligations**:
   - The estimation of the council's pension liabilities involves several complex judgments related to factors like the discount rate, salary increases, retirement ages, mortality rates, and expected returns on pension fund assets.
   - **Actuarial Assumptions**: The actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually and can materially impact the pension liability valuation. For example, a 0.05% increase in the discount rate and a 0.15% decrease in pension inflation reduced the pension asset valuation from **£325.8 million** (2022/23) to **£311.8 million** (2023/24), a movement of **£14 million**.
   - **Sensitivity Analysis**: The document provides an analysis of how different factors might influence the pension liability. A 0.1% decrease in the real discount rate would increase the employer's pension liability by approximately **£19.998 million**. A 0.1% increase in the salary increase rate would increase the liability by **£1.264 million**, while a 0.1% increase in the pension rate would raise the liability by **£19.072 million**. Additionally, a one-year increase in life expectancy would increase the pension liability by **4%**, or **£43.615 million**.

3. **Fair Value Measurements**:
   - As of **31 March 2024**, the council holds assets valued at **£0.337 billion** related to surplus assets, Level 2 and Level 3 financial instruments, and pension plan assets. These assets' valuations are subject to greater estimation uncertainty because they cannot be measured using quoted prices in active markets.
   - The valuations are based on observable inputs when possible, but when these are unavailable, judgments and assumptions play a significant role in determining the fair value. Changes in assumptions can result in substantial adjustments to asset and liability valuations.

4. **Debtors**:
   - The council’s debtor balance as of **31 March 2024** is **£45.7 million**, consisting of:
     - **£13 million** in accounts receivable debtors.
     - **£26 million** in Council Tax debtors.
     - **£6.7 million** in Housing Rent debtors.
   - In the fiscal year 2023/24, the council wrote off or provided for **£25.1 million** worth of debt, recognizing the uncertainty in debt collection.

5. **Impact of Assumptions**:
   - The council expects that future changes in actuarial assumptions, discount rates, and other factors will continue to significantly impact financial valuations, especially for pension obligations and the fair value of assets.

**Statistics:**

- **Pension Asset Valuation**:
   - **2023/24**: **£311.8 million** (a decrease of **£14 million** from **£325.8 million** in 2022/23).
   - **Unfunded Pension Liability for 2023/24**: **£20.040 million** (compared to **£20.672 million** in 2022/23).

- **Sensitivity Analysis on Pension Liabilities**:
   - A **0.1% decrease** in the real discount rate would increase the liability by **£19.998 million**.
   - A **0.1% increase** in the salary increase rate would raise the liability by **£1.264 million**.
   - A **0.1% increase** in the pension rate would increase the liability by **£19.072 million**.
   - A **1-year increase** in life expectancy would increase the liability by **£43.615 million**.

- **Fair Value of Surplus Assets** (as of **31 March 2024**): **£0.337 billion**.

- **Debtor Balance** (as of **31 March 2024**): **£45.7 million**, broken down into:
   - **£13 million** in accounts receivable debtors.
   - **£26 million** in Council Tax debtors.
   - **£6.7 million** in Housing Rent debtors.
   - **£25.1 million** in debt written off or provided for in 2023/24.

These statistics provide detailed insight into how sensitive the council’s pension liabilities and asset valuations are to changes in economic factors, as well as the current status of the council’s debtors.

**Title: Page 125**

**Detailed Summary:**

This page continues the discussion on assumptions made about future events and sources of estimation uncertainty, focusing on debtors, property valuation, and asset depreciation.

1. **Debtors**:
   - The council reviewed all debtors' balances as of **31 March 2024** and determined that a total allowance for doubtful debts of **£25.1 million** was appropriate. This provision is based on factors such as historical recovery rates, individual debt assessments, and aging analysis of debt at the year-end.
   - The breakdown of the provision for doubtful debts includes:
     - **£0.6 million** for accounts receivable.
     - **£18.7 million** for Council Tax.
     - **£5.8 million** for housing rent and homeless debtors.
   - The increase in outstanding debt not provided for is **£2.8 million**, rising from **£8.1 million** in 2022/23 to **£10.9 million** in 2023/24. This increase reflects the reduction in the provision for bad debt for Council Tax, which dropped from **2.25%** to **2%** due to improved collection rates.
   - The council acknowledges that ongoing economic uncertainty, including the cost of living crisis, continues to create a challenging environment for debt recovery.
   - If collection rates were to decline, a **10% increase** in the provision for doubtful debts would require an additional **£2.1 million** to be set aside.

2. **Valuation of Property**:
   - The valuation of the council's property, plant, and equipment (PPE) is subject to significant estimation uncertainty due to factors such as changes in replacement costs, asset condition, regulatory standards, and useful economic lives.
   - As of **31 March 2024**, the total value of the council's assets is detailed in Note 14.1, but the valuation can vary significantly due to the material nature of these assets.
   - In **2023/24**, revaluations were conducted for various assets, including cemetery land, sports pitches, golf courses, bowling greens, tennis courts, pavilions, landfill sites, and civic amenity sites. These revaluations, based on depreciated replacement cost (DRC), resulted in:
     - A net upwards revaluation of **£21.1 million** (an increase of **10.7%** from the previous valuation).
     - A revaluation movement of **£17.7 million** was charged to the Comprehensive Income and Expenditure Account.
     - **£38.8 million** was credited to the Revaluation Reserve, contributing to the net revaluation increase of **£21.1 million**.
   - If the useful life of assets is reduced, depreciation increases, and the carrying amount falls. A **1-year reduction** in the useful life of buildings would increase the annual depreciation charge by **£2.6 million**.
   - The council’s Property Services Manager assessed that as of **31 March 2024**, there were no material changes requiring an early revaluation for assets not already subject to revaluation.

3. **Asset Valuation Sensitivity**:
   - The council's assets subject to the 5-year revaluation cycle have a total value of **£2 billion**.
   - Assets revalued in **2023/24** were valued at **£196.7 million** before revaluation. A **5% change** in asset valuation would result in a movement of **£9.8 million**, either increasing or decreasing the council's revaluation reserve or causing an impairment charge.

**Statistics:**

- **Allowance for Doubtful Debts** (as of **31 March 2024**):
   - Total provision: **£25.1 million**.
     - **£0.6 million** for accounts receivable.
     - **£18.7 million** for Council Tax.
     - **£5.8 million** for housing rent and homeless debtors.
   - Increase in outstanding debt not provided for: **£2.8 million** (from **£8.1 million** in 2022/23 to **£10.9 million** in 2023/24).
   - If collection rates worsened by **10%**, an additional **£2.1 million** would need to be set aside.

- **Property Valuation**:
   - Revaluation of assets in **2023/24** resulted in a net increase of **£21.1 million**.
     - **£17.7 million** charged to the Comprehensive Income and Expenditure Account.
     - **£38.8 million** credited to the Revaluation Reserve.
   - If the useful life of assets decreased by **1 year**, depreciation would increase by **£2.6 million** annually.

- **Valuation Sensitivity**:
   - The council's total assets under the 5-year revaluation cycle are valued at **£2 billion**.
   - A **5% change** in the valuation of assets revalued in 2023/24 (totaling **£196.7 million**) would result in a **£9.8 million** impact.

These statistics provide a detailed understanding of how debtors, property valuations, and asset depreciation estimates could impact the council’s financial position, along with the sensitivity of these valuations to various economic factors.

### Title: Page 138

### Detailed Summary:
This page provides a continuation of the discussion on the fair value of assets and liabilities carried at amortized cost and introduces the nature and extent of financial risks arising from the council’s use of financial instruments. It covers how the council manages its exposure to various financial risks, including credit risk, liquidity risk, refinancing risk, and market risk.

1. **Fair Value of Financial Liabilities:**
   The fair value of the council’s Public Works Loan Board (PWLB) loans and non-PWLB loans (LOBOs and temporary borrowings) is assessed using rates provided by Link Asset Services. The fair value of these liabilities is lower than the carrying amount, as many of the council’s loans carry interest rates lower than current market rates.

2. **Nature and Extent of Risks Arising from Financial Instruments:**
   The council’s financial activities expose it to multiple risks, including:
   - **Credit Risk:** The possibility that other parties may fail to meet their obligations to the council. This risk is mitigated by using only high-quality banks and financial institutions, as determined by credit ratings.
   - **Liquidity Risk:** The risk that the council might not have sufficient funds to meet its payment obligations.
   - **Refinancing Risk:** The risk of needing to renew financial instruments at disadvantageous rates or terms.
   - **Market Risk:** The possibility of financial loss due to changes in interest rates or stock market movements.

3. **Credit Risk Management:**
   Credit risk arises from lending surplus funds and the creditworthiness of the council’s customers. The council manages this risk through a Treasury Management Plan that restricts deposits to high-quality financial institutions with strong credit ratings.

### Statistics:

#### **Fair Value of Financial Liabilities (31 March 2024 vs 31 March 2023):**

- **PWLB Loans:**
  - **Carrying Amount:** £604,529k (2024), £584,379k (2023)
  - **Fair Value:** £480,493k (2024), £499,476k (2023)

- **LOBOs and Temporary Borrowings:**
  - **Carrying Amount:** £63,449k (2024), £63,467k (2023)
  - **Fair Value:** £56,675k (2024), £61,915k (2023)

- **Total Financial Liabilities:**
  - **Carrying Amount:** £667,978k (2024), £647,846k (2023)
  - **Fair Value:** £537,168k (2024), £561,391k (2023)

#### **Credit Risk – Credit Ratings and Investments (31 March 2024):**

- **Money Market Funds (AAA-rated):** £8,820k (35%)
- **West Calder High School DBFM (AA-rated):** £281k (1%)
- **Bank of Scotland Plc (A+ rated):** £7,381k (29%)
- **Santander UK Plc (A-rated):** £9,000k (35%)

- **Total Investments:** £25,482k

This page offers a comprehensive view of how the council manages financial risks associated with its investments and liabilities, with particular emphasis on credit risk management. It also provides a detailed analysis of the fair value of the council's financial liabilities relative to their carrying amounts.

### Title: Page 139

### Detailed Summary:
This page provides a continuation of the discussion on financial risks associated with financial instruments, with a particular focus on **credit risk**, **liquidity risk**, and an analysis of **maturity profiles** for the council’s financial liabilities.

1. **Credit Risk:**
   The council's Treasury Management Plan sets limits on the duration and amount of deposits, using data from credit rating agencies and other risk indicators to minimize exposure. The plan ensures deposits are placed only with high-quality institutions, reducing the likelihood of defaults. For the year ending 31 March 2024, there was no evidence of potential credit losses on bank deposits.

2. **Expected Credit Losses:**
   The document outlines the expected credit losses model, with impairment losses calculated for financial assets. The council provides for potential defaults by customers and adjusts for market conditions. In 2023/24, the council recognized credit losses related to receivables (debtors).

3. **Debtor Analysis:**
   The document provides a breakdown of outstanding customer debts by age, showing how much of the debt is past its due date for payment.

4. **Liquidity Risk:**
   The council manages liquidity risk through careful borrowing practices, ensuring that no more than 15% of loans mature in any given year. The council primarily borrows from the Public Works Loan Board (PWLB) and has safeguards to prevent large amounts of borrowing from maturing at once. 

5. **Maturity Profile of Financial Liabilities:**
   The maturity analysis of financial liabilities shows how much debt is due in different time periods, from less than one year to over ten years.

### Statistics:

#### **Credit Risk:**

- **Deposits with Banks and Building Societies (31 March 2024):** £25,655k
- **Customers (Other Income):**
  - **Total Amount:** £45,717k
  - **Expected Credit Loss (2%):** £914k

- **Age Analysis of Debtors (Past Due):**
  - **Less than three months:** £2,362k
  - **Three to six months:** £1,576k
  - **Six months to one year:** £7,722k (including £5,752k in local taxation debts)
  - **More than one year:** £23,118k (including £20,218k in local taxation debts)
  - **Total Past Due Debt (31 March 2024):** £34,778k

- **Provision for Bad Debts (31 March 2024):** £25.125 million (72% of outstanding debt)
- **Provision for Bad Debts (31 March 2023):** £25.428 million (78% of outstanding debt)

#### **Liquidity Risk:**

- **Maturity Profile of Financial Liabilities (31 March 2024 vs 31 March 2023):**
  - **Less than one year:** £79,337k (2024), £69,205k (2023)
  - **Between one and two years:** £873k (2024), £0k (2023)
  - **Between two and five years:** £22,500k (2024), £13,373k (2023)
  - **Between six and ten years:** £92,500k (2024), £67,500k (2023)
  - **More than ten years:** £472,768k (2024), £497,768k (2023)
  - **Total Financial Liabilities:** £667,978k (2024), £647,846k (2023)

This page provides detailed insights into the council’s risk management practices, particularly in relation to credit and liquidity risks. The data also includes a comprehensive analysis of the council’s debtor balances and the maturity schedule of its financial liabilities.

### Title: Page 140

### Detailed Summary:
This page continues the discussion on financial risks related to the council's financial instruments, with a focus on **refinancing and maturity risk**, **market risk**, **price risk**, and **foreign exchange risk**. It explains how the council manages these risks through various strategies, including prudent debt management and interest rate monitoring.

1. **Refinancing and Maturity Risk:**
   - The council manages a large portfolio of debt and investments, with an emphasis on mitigating risks related to the maturity of financial liabilities and assets. The council’s policy limits the maturity of debt, ensuring that no more than 15% of loans are due to mature within a single financial year. Monitoring is done to align with the council’s day-to-day liquidity needs and long-term cash flow planning.

2. **Market Risk:**
   - Changes in market interest rates impact both the cost of borrowing and the return on investments. The council manages these uncertainties by limiting variable-rate borrowing to a maximum of 35% of total borrowing. As of 31 March 2024, the council had no variable-rate debt. The council also monitors interest rates to take advantage of periods when restructuring fixed-rate debt might be economically favorable.
   - An example of interest rate sensitivity is provided, showing that a 1% rise in interest rates would result in an additional £660k of income, with £266k benefiting the Housing Revenue Account.

3. **Price Risk:**
   - The council holds 25,000 ordinary shares in **Lothian Buses Limited**, which, while a small holding, carries some risk associated with fluctuations in the share price.

4. **Foreign Exchange Risk:**
   - The council does not engage in lending or borrowing in foreign currencies and, therefore, has no exposure to foreign exchange risk.

### Statistics:

#### **Refinancing and Maturity Risk:**
- The council ensures no more than **15%** of loans mature in any single financial year.
- **LOBO Loans** are classified as maturing on the next rate review date, though they are unlikely to be repaid at that point.

#### **Market Risk - Interest Rate Sensitivity (1% increase in rates for 2023/24):**
- **Increase in interest receivable on variable-rate lending:** £660k
- **Net effect on Income and Expenditure Account:** £660k
- **Housing Revenue Account’s Share:** £266k

#### **Price Risk:**
- The council holds **25,000 shares** in Lothian Buses Limited, with potential risk from share price movements.

#### **Foreign Exchange Risk:**
- The council does not borrow or lend in foreign currencies, so there is no exposure to exchange rate fluctuations.

This page outlines how the council actively manages various financial risks through policies on debt maturity, market rate monitoring, and liquidity planning. The analysis provides a detailed example of how market conditions, such as interest rate changes, could affect the council's financial position.

### Detailed Summary:
This document outlines the pension schemes applicable to the council's employees for the fiscal year 2023/24, focusing on the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) and the Teachers’ Pension Scheme. The council contributes to both schemes as part of employee post-employment benefits. Additionally, it covers the risks associated with these pension schemes, the Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP), and the implications of the McCloud judgement concerning age discrimination in pension reform.

1. **Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS)**:
   - Administered by the City of Edinburgh Council under the Local Government Pension Scheme (Scotland) Regulations 2018.
   - This is a funded defined benefit final salary scheme, where both the council and employees contribute to balance the pension liabilities with investment assets.
   
2. **Teachers’ Pension Scheme**:
   - Administered by the Scottish Public Pensions Agency, it provides defined benefits for teachers, with the council contributing based on a percentage of pensionable salaries.
   - As the scheme cannot identify each council’s share of liabilities, it is accounted for as a defined contribution scheme.

3. **Principal Risks**:
   - Risks include longevity assumptions, statutory changes, inflation, bond yields, and equity performance. These risks are somewhat mitigated by statutory requirements.

4. **Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP)**:
   - Accrued between 1978 and 1997, GMP's value is unequal between men and women, but equality was previously achieved through state pension interactions. This was disrupted by the introduction of the Single State Pension in 2016, leading to potential inequalities.
   - The council’s actuary has estimated the impact of the GMP indexation changes, and the increased liability is reflected in the valuation.

5. **McCloud Judgement**:
   - Following a legal challenge, the Court of Appeal found that the transitional provisions of the 2015 pension reforms resulted in unlawful age discrimination.
   - The Supreme Court refused the UK Government’s request to appeal, and the government accepted the decision, beginning consultations on how to remedy the discrimination.
   - The impact of the McCloud judgement has been factored into the pension valuations.

### Key Statistics:
- **Teachers' Pension Contributions**:
   - 2023/24: The council paid £25.886 million (up from £21.647 million in 2022/23) at a rate of 23% of pensionable pay.
   - 2022/23: The same contribution rate of 23% applied, amounting to £21.647 million.
   - Additional pension payments related to added years in 2023/24 amounted to £0.320 million, down slightly from £0.329 million in 2022/23. These represent 0.18% and 0.22% of pensionable pay, respectively.

- **Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP)**:
   - Actuarial estimates have been adjusted to account for the potential impact of indexation changes, with the costs incorporated into the financial reporting of West Lothian Council.

- **McCloud Judgement Impact**:
   - Adjustments in pension liabilities were made following consultations and actuarial estimates in 2020, reflecting withdrawal rates, salary increases, and local assumptions. The financial implications of this judgement have been fully accounted for in the valuation results.

This document reflects the financial responsibilities and obligations the council faces regarding employee pensions, including significant legal and financial adjustments due to external rulings and changes in pension regulations.

**Title: Page 143**

### Detailed Summary:
This section continues with the pension schemes and specifically addresses the calculations related to net asset restrictions, transactions involving post-employment benefits, and the financial impact of these pension plans on the council’s accounts. The figures are calculated under the International Accounting Standard (IAS) 19 and the IFRIC 14 guidance, which define how pension liabilities and assets should be recognized on the balance sheet.

1. **Net Asset Restriction Calculation**:
   - The council’s IAS19-defined benefit plan surplus for 2023/24 is calculated to be £311.841 million, a slight decrease from £325.788 million in 2022/23.
   - IAS19 limits the recognition of a net defined benefit asset to the lower of the surplus and the asset ceiling. The asset ceiling is calculated as the present value of economic benefits in the form of refunds or reduced contributions. The actuary has determined that future contributions, valued at £2.790 billion, exceed the service costs, valued at £2.654 billion, by £136 million, a negative contribution. As a result, no asset is recognized under IFRIC 14, and there is no liability for this difference.
   - The council has recognized £20.040 million as a long-term liability for unfunded pension obligations in 2023/24, down from £20.672 million in 2022/23 (restated based on current guidance).

2. **Transactions Relating to Post-Employment Benefits**:
   - Various transactions were made in the Comprehensive Income and Expenditure Statement and the General Fund Balance through the Movement in Reserves Statement.
   - The current service cost (representing the cost of providing pensions for the service employees have rendered in the current year) was £33.738 million for 2023/24, compared to £67.416 million in 2022/23.
   - Past service costs, representing costs from changes in pension benefits related to prior periods, were £125,000 for 2023/24, compared to £30,000 in 2022/23.
   - The net interest expense on the pension plan was a gain of £104,000 in 2023/24, compared to an expense of £4.334 million in 2022/23.

3. **Remeasurement of the Net Defined Benefit Liability**:
   - Remeasurement gains and losses reflect changes in actuarial assumptions or differences between expected and actual outcomes.
   - Return on plan assets (excluding the net interest expense) was a gain of £18.339 million in 2023/24, compared to a loss of £6.808 million in 2022/23.
   - Actuarial gains from changes in demographic assumptions amounted to £19.914 million for 2023/24, compared to £10.861 million in 2022/23.
   - Actuarial gains from changes in financial assumptions were £38.161 million for 2023/24, significantly reduced from £574.011 million in 2022/23.
   - The elimination of the prior year asset ceiling adjustment contributed a decrease of £361.935 million in 2023/24, and the application of the current year asset ceiling resulted in a reduction of £331.881 million.
   - Total post-employment benefits charged to the Comprehensive Income and Expenditure Statement were £36.141 million in 2023/24, compared to a reduction of £88.658 million in 2022/23.

4. **Movement in Reserves Statement**:
   - Reversal of net charges for post-employment benefits was £3.014 million in 2023/24, compared to a reversal of £37.433 million in 2022/23.
   - Actual amounts charged against the General Fund Balance for pensions included employer contributions of £34.866 million in 2023/24 (up from £32.549 million in 2022/23) and contributions for unfunded benefits of £1.907 million in 2023/24 (up from £1.798 million in 2022/23).
   - The total amount charged to taxation for the Lothian Pension Fund Scheme was £36.371 million in 2023/24, compared to £34.023 million in 2022/23.

### Detailed Summary:
This section of the document continues detailing various financial adjustments and movements in the council’s reserves and cash flow statement. It covers the **Financial Instruments Adjustment Account**, the **Pension Fund Reserve**, the **Employee Statutory Adjustment Account**, and the cash flow from operating activities.

1. **Financial Instruments Adjustment Account**:
   - This account balances differences between statutory requirements and accounting practices related to the council's borrowing and lending activities. The movement in the account reflects the re-measurement of financial instruments, particularly deferred premiums from debt rescheduling and market LOBO loans.

   - The Pension Fund Reserve mirrors the net pension liability and shows movements over the year. A significant actuarial gain is noted, but the IFRIC 14 adjustment (asset ceiling) reduces the net pension reserve.

3. **Employee Statutory Adjustment Account**:
   - This account absorbs the impact of accruing for employee absences (such as annual and maternity leave) that have been earned but not taken by the fiscal year-end. Statutory arrangements require these differences to be neutralized by transfers to or from the account.

4. **Cash Flow Statement - Operating Activities**:
   - This section shows key components of the council’s cash flow from operating activities, such as interest paid and received, adjustments for non-cash items like depreciation and amortization, and changes in working capital items like debtors and creditors.

**Title: Page 156**

**Detailed Summary:**
This section continues the discussion from the previous page regarding **Leasing, PPP (Public-Private Partnerships), and DBFM (Design, Build, Finance, and Maintain) Payments**, specifically for the West Calder High School project. It also includes future cash payment projections for the council’s PPP and DBFM projects, a description of service concessions related to PPP/DBFM contracts, and an overview of related party transactions.

1. **Education Service DBFM West Calder High School Project:**
   - This is a 25-year contract for the construction and maintenance of West Calder High School, which became operational in August 2018. The contractor is responsible for the majority of the school’s ongoing maintenance, while the council is responsible for janitorial, cleaning, and some elements of maintenance.
   - The contract expires in 2043, with annual payments indexed to RPI. The council carries the price and consumption risks for utilities and a 30% share of any refinancing gains from qualifying refinances.

3. **PPP/DBFM Service Concessions:**
   - Scottish Government Finance Circular 10/2022 allows flexibility in accounting for service concession arrangements in place prior to 1 April 2022.

The document outlines both income and expenditure for 2023/24 and compares it to 2022/23, providing insights into the net costs of HRA services and the overall deficit for the year. It also breaks down HRA services’ share of corporate costs and other adjustments.

This section of the document covers "Trusts and Mortifications Statement 13," where the council acts as the sole trustee for 40 trusts and mortifications.

The assets of the trusts are divided into investments and revenue advances to the loans fund, with no liabilities recorded for these trusts.

The notes section explains the council’s policy of preserving the capital value of trust funds, disbursing only the revenue income generated, and doing so one year in arrears. It also provides details on the primary trusts managed by the council and their financial positions, as well as mentioning additional trusts managed with external and council trustees.
