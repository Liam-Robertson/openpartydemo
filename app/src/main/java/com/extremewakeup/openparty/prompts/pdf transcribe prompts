Summarise the followings pdfs i give you. Give them a title and summarise the key information

Follow these rules:
- Don't miss out any numbers or statistics that are brought up
- I want the summaries to be very detailed.
    - It's better to make a longer summary and include all important details than to be brief and miss details
- Summarise each page on the document individually i.e. if a pdf has 100 pages, then I want 100 summaries
- The summary size should correspond to the length of the document.
    - For example, if it's a 100 page pdf then the summary should be very long
    - For example, if it's a 2 page pdf then the summary should be much shorter
- At the end, give an overall summary of the entire pdf
