Three Screens:
- Newsfeed
- Budget
- Proposal

Newsfeed:
- Should give you a summary of everything that the local council has been working on in the recent period
- Should have two sliders, one for detail, one for timeline
- If you increase the detail slider, it will give you a larger more detailed summary of what's been happening
- In the future, the newsfeed will be tailored more to your interests. If you care about a certain proposal, it will bias the newsfeed towards showing you that proposal

Proposal:
- This lets users raise proposals about what should happen
