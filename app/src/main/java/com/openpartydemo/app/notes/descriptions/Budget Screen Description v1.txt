Budget Screen:
- The aim of the budget screen is to represent the amount of spending in each area of government in pie chart form
- It gets information about government spending from a json file, calculates the percentage spending in each area, then displays that information to the user in a pie chart#
  - The json data file is stored in the file path: app/assets
  - I have included an example of what the json data will look like at the bottom 
- The budget screen has three parts:
    - A title saying "West Lothian Budget"
    - A pie chart. This has a legend showing what each section corresponds to
    - A footer:
        - The footer is used for navigation
        - It is made up of three sections - a budget section, a newsfeed section and a proposals section
        - Each section is represented by an icon
        - When the user clicks on a section, it navigates to that page
        - When the app is first opens, it defaults navigation to the budget section
        - When the budget screen is open, the budget section is highlighted. When the minutes screen is open, the minutes section is highlighted

When the user enters the budget screen this happens:
- The data about the financial report is fetched from the json file
    - In future, this data will be stored in a table but since this is a version 1 it's hardcoded in a json file 
- The percentage cost of each area of level 1 spending is calculated
  - For example, if Education costs £10 million, and the total cost is £100 million, then education is 10% 
- If an area of spending is less than 5% of total spending, it is grouped into a Miscellaneous category 
- The pie chart is then populated with the data
  - It will show all areas of spending greater than 5% such as Education or Social Services, and it will also show a miscellaneous category (which represents everything under 5%)
  - The pie chart is populated using data only from level 1 of spending at this point, not from level 2 or level 3 spending
  - The pie chart shows each section of spending proportionally to it's percentage of overall spending 
    - For example, if education spending was 22% of total spending, it would take up 22% of the overall pie chart 
- There will be a legend at the bottom of the screen which shows each area of spending, it's cost and it's colour on the pie chart
- If the user clicks on a section in the legend, the app shows a new pie chart which gives a more detailed breakdown of that type of spending
  - For example if the user clicks on Education Services in the legend, it shows the user a new title, pie chart and legend
    - This time, the title would be the level 1 spending, the pie chart and legend would show all the level 2 spending inside the level 1 spending 
    - For example, if the user clicks Social Care Services in the legend, then a screen is shown where the title is Social Care Services, and the pie chart and legend have Adult and Elderly Services (IJB), Children's Services (Non-IJB)
    - There is also a back button at the top left of the page which takes the user back to the level 1 spending diagram 
- The same applies for level 3 of spending i.e. if the user clicks a section of level 2 spending in the legend, it will take them to level 3 spending diagram 
  - For example, if the user clicked Housing Revenue Account (HRA), it would show a screen where the title is Housing Revenue Account (HRA), and the pie chart and legend show Repairs and Maintenance, Supervision and Management etc
