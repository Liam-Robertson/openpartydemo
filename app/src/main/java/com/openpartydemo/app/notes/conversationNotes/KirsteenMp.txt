Summary:
- She was pretty hesitant, raised a lot more concern than optimism
- When shown the budget screen, she was very hesitant about it
    - Her point was that, if you show people complicated data they wouldn't understand it
    - They would then use that to prove points that aren't really valid
    - i.e. they would use that data to spin whatever point they wanted to make
- For the issues screen she had concerns
    - Primary concern was that people would raise issues that are unrelated to the local council i.e. the NHS
    - Secondary concern was that you can't actually solve issues just because they're raised
    - For example, if you raise the issue of housing shortages, you can't just solve that
    - Housing shortages are due to things like local councils not being able to get licenses or people not wanting it in their backyard
    - Just because someone raises an issue doesn't mean it can be fixed
- On a more positive note, she gave me some local organisations to contact
- She seemed to be more optimistic about my ability to help local organisations rather than help people access the council

My thoughts:
- I'm not surprised about her concerns, most of them were things i had already thought of
- She was very concerned and quite negative overall
- I think that's roughly the reception you can expect from MPs, I wouldn't expect people to be happy about this
- Generally I think you can expect people to think this is a bad idea and you would have to try very hard to convince them
- The local communities thing is a good place to start though, that's a ripe group of people who are interested in the community
    - If you are going to have a first set of users it's likely to be there
- She also seemed quite positive about Tom Conn, sounds like a fierce guy who's passionate about his community
- But yeah, overall she seemed very negative, I think that's roughly the same reaction you should expect from all councillors
- Don't expect them to embrace this idea, expect to have to fight hard to convince them
- Having said that, I don't think I need lots of councillors on my side initially, I think I just need one
- If you had one councillor on your side, and a few people who were interested in the idea, that would be enough to get started.
- Her note about local community volunteer groups was interesting but I can't write apps for them
- It just sounds too boring, spending all my time to use AI to summarise websites of volunteer groups sounds mind numbing
