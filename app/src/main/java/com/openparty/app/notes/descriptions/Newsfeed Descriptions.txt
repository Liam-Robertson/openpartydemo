Newsfeed Screen: 
- The newsfeed screen should be a newsfeed showing latest things that have happened in local goverment 
- The newsfeed screen should consist of these parts: 
- Title saying "Newsfeed" in the top left
- Cards that show each newsfeed item 
    - Each card should have an image relating to the newsfeed item
    - It also has a title relating to the newsfeed item that gives a one line summary of the item 
        - The title should be attention grabbing or eye catching 
- If the user clicks on a newsfeed item, it navigates them to the newsfeedItemScreen 

Newsfeed Item Screen:
- The newsfeed item screen shows the newsfeed shows the item in classic newspaper format 
- The text should all be centred in the middle 90% of the screen 
- There should be a big bold title
- There should be a subtitle
- There should be an image under that 
- Then there should be the content of the article itself 

Data: 
- In future this system will use a database to store all of it's data
- However this is just a version 1 so right now all of the data is hardcoded in json 
- The data will be stored in app/assets/newsfeedScreen

The data for each newsfeed item would look like this: 
- It would be json
- it would have a id, title, a subheader, a reference to where the image is stored, content, timestamp 

Here is some example fake data: 
{
  "newsfeed": [
