Script:
Hi X, I'm Liam. I'm working as part of an initiative to make local government more acccessible in Bathgate and Linlithgow and I was hoping to get your advice on it.

So right now we have two major aims, one of them is to make local government more accessible to people, so to make it easier for constituents to raise issues and get their problems solved
The second one is to make it more clear where the budget for the government is spent and why it's spent that way
Right now we're a group of about 10 people working in Bathgate and Linlithgow and we're trying to come up with solutions on how to meet those goals
I was hoping to get a meeting with you so I could get a bit of background on how you see the local community and how you think we could go about this
Could we be book in a meeting to go over this?
