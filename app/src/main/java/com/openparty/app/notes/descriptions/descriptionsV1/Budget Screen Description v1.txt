Budget Screen:
- The aim of the budget screen is to represent the amount of spending in each area of government in pie chart form
- It gets information about government spending from a database, calculates the percentage spending in each area, then displays that information to the user in a pie chart
- The budget screen has three parts:
    - A title saying "Budget"
    - A pie chart. This has a legend showing what each section corresponds to
    - A footer:
        - The footer is used for navigation
        - It is made up of three sections - a budget section, a newsfeed section and a proposals section
        - Each section is represented by an icon
        - When the user clicks on a section, it navigates to that page
        - When the app is first opens, it defaults navigation to the budget section
        - When the budget screen is open, the budget section is highlighted. When the minutes screen is open, the minutes section is highlighted

When the user enters the budget screen this happens:
- The data about the financial report is fetched
    - The data about the financial report will be stored in a separate file
    - Right now this is just a version 1 of an app, so the data will be hardcoded
    - The data will be hardcoded for each section
    - The data will be in this format:
{
  "areas_of_spending": [
    {
      "type_of_spending": "Education Services",
      "cost": "£220.806 million",
      "summary": "This category encompasses all spending related to educational services provided by the council, including staffing costs for teachers and support staff, educational materials, school maintenance, and administrative support.",
      "subtypes_level_1": [
        {
          "type_of_spending": "Schools and Education Support",
          "cost": "£220.806 million",
          "summary": "This subtype includes costs for teaching staff salaries, educational materials, school facility maintenance, special education needs, and administrative support services.",
          "subtypes_level_2": [
            {
              "type_of_spending": "Early Learning and Childcare",
              "cost": "£17.850 million",
              "summary": "Provision of early childhood education and childcare services for children under the age of five."
            },
.....

    - i.e. the data will be in json format with the area of spending, the cost the summary and then the same again for all the subtypes of spending
    - When the user enters the screen, the data will be fetched from the json file which is com.openparty.app.notes.descriptionsV1.financeDataV1.json
    - This data will then be used to populate the pie chart
    - The pie chart will initially just be populated using the highest level of data i.e. type of spending, not type of spending level 1 or level 2
    - There will be a legend at the bottom of the screen which shows each area of spending, it's cost and it's colour on the pie chart
    - If the user clicks on a section in the legend, the app shows a new pie chart which gives a more detailed breakdown of that type of spending
    - For example, the initial pie chart might show up with Education Services, Social Care Services, Housing services
    - Each of these would be represented in the pie chart as a different colour, and each would take up a piece of the pie chart proportional to the level of spending on them
        - e.g. if Education was 37% of spending it would take up 37% of the pie chart
    - At the bottom of the screen is a legend showing Education Services, Social Care Services, Housing services - along with the colour and cost associated with each
    - If the user then clicked on Social Care Services in the legend, a new pie chart would appear which has all the subtypes of Social Care Services spending
        - i.e."Adult and Elderly Services (IJB)", "Children's Services (Non-IJB)"
    - The new pie chart would have each sub type of spending
    - The new legend would have the sub type of spending, the colour on the pie chart, the cost
    - If the user clicks on a subtype of spending in the legend, then a new pie chart would appear for sub type level 2
    - The new pie chart and legend would have the type of spending, cost and colour for spending sub type 2 in the json file

Navigation:
- The navigation needs to be able to handle navigating between the budget section, newsfeed section and proposals section
- This app is going to get a lot more complex so the navigation functionality needs to be able to handle that
- The navigation should probably have it's own feature
