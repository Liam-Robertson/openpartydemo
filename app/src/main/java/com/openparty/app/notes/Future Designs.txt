- Add descriptions to each section of the budget screen
    - For example, on the main screen it should give a brief overview of what healthcare money is spent on
    - If you click the healthcare section, it will give you a more granular explanation of what heathcare is spent on and what the subsections are
- Add subsections to the budget screen
    - Give the user the ability to click on a section like "Healthcare" and be taken to a more granular breakdown of that section
    - The more granular breakdown should show all the subsections of healthcare spending and display them in a pie chart
- If you suggest that more money should be spent on something, you need to also specify where that money comes from
- Train the AI so that you can ask it questions and it can consume data from many different places

Maybe:
- AI accountability:
    - You used to have an idea that there should be a series of lawyer/accountants who would hold government agencies accountable
    - They would look into each agency, audit it and see if they were doing a good or a bad job
    - What if you did that for local government

-  Comparing audits:
    - Get audits for every region
    - Breakdown the audits to show spending for every region
    - Use this to see where your council spends more/less money than other councils
    - Then compare this against metrics for things like healthcare/education to see if these metrics are paying off

- Crowdsourcing performance metrics:
    - To make this system work, you would ideally want to cross reference financial spending against performance metrics
    - This would show the constituents whether they're money was being spent well or badly
    - Financial data you can probably get, but performance metrics are harder
    - One way to get performance metrics would be to crowdsource them from the local users of the app in some way
    - If you could do that it would be much more useful

- Ad hoc data science
    - At some point you'll have lots of performance metrics and financial data on many counties
    - You allow the user to perform ad hoc data science on these metrics to find patterns
    - Just let them generate their own graphs and charts
