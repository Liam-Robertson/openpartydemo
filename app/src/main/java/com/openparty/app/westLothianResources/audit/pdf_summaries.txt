Title: Page 1: Examination of the 2023/24 Audit and Best Value Thematic Review: A Report to the Audit Committee

Summary: This text serves as a report of the 2023/24 audit and best value thematic review developed by the acting head of finance and property services. The report advises the Audit Committee on the outcomes of the said audit through a summary of the key elements derived from both the Auditor's Annual Report and the Best Value Thematic Review for the year 2023/24. It also recommends that the Audit Committee reviews Audit Scotland's Annual Audit Report and Best Value Thematic Review Report on Workforce Innovation, along with the audited Annual Accounts for the year 2023/24. Although the report is framed in accordance with the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 for the council's cognizance and auditing committee's scrutiny, it specifies no impact on performance indicators and no necessity for resource issues predicting on council's attention.
